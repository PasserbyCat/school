In WWII, Nationalist troops seized the most important pieces in order to prevent invaders from ransacking China's national treasures. A twist of fate eventually brought these treasures to Taiwan. The Taipei National Palace Museum is designed in the style of a Northern Chinese palace. The museum is home to hundreds of thousands of historical relics that make up the world's most comprehensive and precious collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. The entire collection covers 5,000 years of China's historical and artistic achievements. The museum provides Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish and Korean language guides and museum-related literature. The museum is a must- see on any visitor's itinerary. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2013/08/28</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/home.htm</xurl><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 221, Sec. 2, Zhishan Rd., Taipei</address><xpostDate>2013/08/28</xpostDate><file><img description="National Palace Museum">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D14/E810/F21/48d66fbd-1ba3-4efd-837a-3767db5f52e0.jpg</img><img description="National Palace Museum_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000721.jpg</img><img description="National Palace Museum_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000723.jpg</img><img description="National Palace Museum_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000722.jpg</img><audio description="Natioanl Palace Museum">http://www.travel.taipei/streams/scenery_file_audio/e18.mp3</audio></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station：MRT Shilin Station -  Bus 304, 255 or Red 30 -  National Palace Museum</info><longitude>121.5496</longitude><latitude>25.1013</latitude><MRT>Shilin  </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>6</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000117</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2885-4376</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_TIME>1.Daily 09:00 to 17:00

The sulfuric steam that blankets the valley year-round gives the valley a frightening quality, giving rise to nicknames like &amp;ldquo;Ghost Lake.&amp;rdquo; The springs here have the highest temperatures of any in the Datunshan volcano group. With its surreal sulfuric atmosphere, it&amp;rsquo;s no wonder Thermal Valley was considered one of the &amp;ldquo;12 great sights of Taiwan&amp;rdquo; during the Period of Japanese Occupation!     The &amp;ldquo;Beitou rocks&amp;rdquo; (aka Hokutolite or Anglesobarite) in Thermal Valley contain the radioactive element radium. Out of the many thousands of minerals existing in the world, they are the only ones named after a place in Taiwan, and can be found in only two places: Beitou and Tamagawa, Japan. In recent years, the &amp;ldquo;Beitou Rock Conservation Area&amp;rdquo; has been established to ensure the protection of these natural rarities. Thus, when visiting Thermal Valley, you not only get to experience &amp;ldquo;hell&amp;rdquo; but also gain insight into some rare radioactive rocks!      Water temperature in Thermal Valley&amp;rsquo;s hot springs ranges from 80-100℃. The sodium carbonate springs tend to be corrosive, and have come to be known as &amp;ldquo;Green sulfur springs&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Sulfur heads.&amp;rdquo; Visitors used to boil eggs in the hot springs, but the practice has since been prohibited&amp;mdash;not only to protect the water quality but to keep tourists from falling in and boiling themselves! </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2011/05/18</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Beitou Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2011/05/18</xpostDate><file><img description="Thermal Valley_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11003993.jpg</img><img description="Thermal Valley">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D457/E341/F171/f6dc25a6-cc44-4e4d-a7ea-aea011e2aa65.jpg</img><img description="Thermal Valley">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D375/E862/F67/dcada704-a151-4b49-ac44-a349e7761973.jpg</img><img description="Thermal Valley">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D293/E834/F864/7493ca40-985e-4d7e-9340-f738b6096c26.jpg</img><img description="Thermal Valley">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D988/E745/F29/cc1e0a3a-0e3c-47dc-88b8-9c7a9ddc606e.jpg</img><img description="Thermal Valley">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D37/E611/F805/ec29667c-0ff6-435a-ab82-2905492d04fc.jpg</img><img description="Thermal Valley">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D202/E23/F478/a219480b-2bb0-4e80-9069-2704c7904545.jpg</img><audio description="Thermal Valley">http://www.travel.taipei/streams/scenery_file_audio/e17.mp3</audio></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station：Xinbeitou</info><longitude>121.511592</longitude><latitude>25.137940</latitude><MRT>Xinbeitou</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>13</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Art and Culture Centers</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000187</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2720-8889#8630</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_FAX>2723-2793</MEMO_FAX><MEMO_TIME>09:00 - 17:00 Closed on Monday</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Discovery Center of Taipei</stitle><xbody>The Discovery Center of Taipei is a museum that chronicles Taipei's development.

Yangmingshan features a widely varying terrain, diverse ecology, and is home to numerous protected species. If you’re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of one of Taiwan’s endemic bird species—the Formosan Blue Magpie.The park is full of plum, cherry, peach and pear trees, rhododendrons, etc. In spring, the cherry blossoms never fail to draw crowds. After cherry blossom season, about mid-March, it’s time for the calla lilies at Bamboo Lake (Zhu-zi-hu) to take center stage. Visitors go into the fields and pick calla lillies to take home with them—it’s become a must-do event for this time of a year! Perhaps one of the most distinctive features in the park is the “Flower Clock,” composed of a variety of colorful seasonal flowers. When visiting Yangmingshan, be sure to take a photo to prove you’ve seen this famous landmark! Also worth checking are popular sights like the Hsiao-you-keng (“Small Oil Pit”), Ching-tien-kang (Qing-tian Hill) Leng-shui-keng (“Cold Water Pit”), and Yangming Archive House. If you enjoy an invigorating hike, these will be right up your alley! The Yangmingshan area also possesses a wealth of geothermal resources, with hot springs having differing compositions depending on their location in the park. Nearby Xing-yi Road in Beitou is lined with hot spring restaurants. If you’re passing along this way, don’t forget to take a relaxing dip in the sulfur springs! Beautiful flowers in the spring, a cool getaway in the summer, silver grass and maple leaves in the fall, hot springs in the winter—Yangmingshan’s distinctive seasonal offerings await your discovery! </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/04</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.ymsnp.gov.tw/</xurl><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2015/03/04</xpostDate><file><img description="Yangmingshan National Park_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11003994.JPG</img><img description="Yangmingshan National Park_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11003995.JPG</img><img description="Yangmingshan National Park_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11003996.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.547742</longitude><latitude>25.15579</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>29</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Bicycle Traces</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000038</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Keelung River Bicycle Trail</stitle><xbody>The bikeways along the left and right banks of the Keelung River can be accessed from the Lin An-tai (No. 10) Evacuation Gate.

In keeping with the sober spirit of Confucianism, the building is appropriately austere. Visitors also won't find the spring couplets common at other types of temples. Some say this is because it would be rude to display the writing of another in a temple dedicated to the Sage. Among the Confucius temples in Taiwan, Taipei's is the only one adorned with southern Fujian-style ceramic applique. At the main hall of the temple one can see a black plaque with gold lettering that reads "Educate without Discrimination." Every year on September 28, a grand ceremony with traditional music and stylized dancing is held at the temple in honor of Confucius.</xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/05</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.ct.taipei.gov.tw/en-us/Home.htm</xurl><address>Datong Dist.,Taipei CityNo.275, Dalong St., Datong District, Taipei City 103</address><xpostDate>2015/03/05</xpostDate><file><img description="Confucius Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D320/E460/F388/ad4e70ab-077e-4a46-a421-2df9bd6c6845.jpg</img><img description="Confucius Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D217/E905/F914/85d0c830-51c7-486a-8640-2c9c25eec14a.jpg</img><img description="Confucius Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D761/E16/F22/bbbcd75e-a242-4265-b7ff-b75a1dc0bccf.jpg</img><img description="Confucius Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D861/E948/F843/897075db-7c40-4822-9f99-15bc62b6443b.jpg</img><img description="Confucius Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F354/694d44be-1a67-4c80-a666-e90c2cf2d9c4.jpg</img><img description="Confucius Temple_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000879.JPG</img><img description="Confucius Temple_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000880.jpg</img><img description="Confucius Temple_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000881.jpg</img><audio description="Taipei Confucian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/streams/scenery_file_audio/e23.mp3</audio></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station：From Yuanshan Station (Exit 2), walk about 10 minutes in the direction of Kulun St.Take the No. 215, 669, 811, or Red 33 bus to the intersection of Kulun St.; the 41, 215, 246, 288, 669, 811, or Red 33 bus to the Kulun St.-Chengde Rd. intersection; or the 2, 41, 215, 246, 288, 669, 811, or Red 33 bus to Dalongdong Baoan Temple.</info><longitude>121.51596</longitude><latitude>25.07238</latitude><MRT>Yuanshan </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>32</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Religious Venues</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000301</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2766-3012</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_FAX>2768-9046</MEMO_FAX><stitle>Songshan Ciyou Temple</stitle><xbody>Built in 1753, Ciyou Temple is dedicated to the deity Black Faced Mazu.

Next, you won&amp;rsquo;t want to miss the hugely popular Koala House and Penguin House. There are also two giant pandas from China! These animals are the Zoo&amp;rsquo;s resident celebrities, so be sure to check them out! The star of the zoo used to be the Asian Elephant &amp;ldquo;Grandpa Lin Wang,&amp;rdquo; who lived to the ripe old age of 86. Lin&amp;rsquo;s longevity&amp;mdash;20 years older than most Asian Elephants&amp;mdash;was hailed by zoologists as a miracle. After his death, Lin was stuffed and put on display, and now enjoys the distinction of being the world&amp;rsquo;s largest stuffed Asian Elephant! You can see him on display in the Education Center. Apart from the indoor exhibits, the Taipei Zoo also features 8 outdoor exhibit areas. The latter are divided according to geographical environment, and possess educational value both as exhibits and ecological environments. The &amp;ldquo;Children&amp;rsquo;s Zoo,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Formosan Animal Area,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;African Animal Area&amp;rdquo; are the most popular, according to Internet voting. The Formosan Animal Area includes endemic species like Formosan sika deer, Taiwan macaque, and Swinhoe&amp;rsquo;s pheasant.

Elephant) Hiking Trail</stitle><xbody>Xiangshan derives its name from its external shape (“xiang” means elephant in Chinese) and is located at the south-eastern section of Xinyi District. Its composition is mainly sandstone, akin to that of Hushan. The tawny cliffs and giant rocks along the path, coupled with numerous natural life forms and birds, make the entire mountain resemble a natural ecological paradise. It’s a great place for the general public to enjoy outdoor leisure time and bask in the beauty of nature.Along the trail there are explanatory sign boards providing information to visitors concerning the environment. The diversified cliff and slope terrains form a great nurturing ground for fern-family plants. In particular, the quantity of Taiwanese Cibotium (Cibotium taiwanianum) and Flying Spider-monkey Tree Fern (Cyathea lepifera) ranks top in Taipei City.Back in the days when medicine was not as advanced as it is today, Taiwanese Cibotium was commonly used to stop bleeding. The Flying Spider-monkey Tree Fern, on the other hand, is the most valuable ecological feature of Taipei City.Standing on the top of Xiangshan, the entire Taipei Basin is right under your eyes. The extension of the ridge reaches into Zhongqiang Park of Xinyi District, and therefore has become the best evening stroll venue for local residents. It is also a great vacation spot for people to relax and relieve stress.The Six Giant Rocks“Laolaixia” is the name given to Xiangshan’s landscape of peculiar giant rocks. On top of these rocks, the entire view of the bustling Xinyi District is captured; it is a popular spot for photo-taking. The rising sun juxtaposed with Taipei 101 and the slumbering Xinyi District skyscrapers provide endless pictures of enjoyment throughout the day and night. </xbody><avBegin>2011/11/13</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.geo.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=38420442&amp;ctNode=67815&amp;mp=106051</xurl><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei CityXiangshan (Mt.

This distinctive structure is located in the lush green environs of Beitou Hot Spring Park, near the Beitou Hot Spring Museum.   This library was the first building in Taiwan to receive the certification of &amp;ldquo;Green Building&amp;rdquo;. The structure makes generous use of French windows and natural light, and blends in with the surrounding environment. Built mainly of wood and steel, it resembles a large treehouse just waiting to welcome visitors.    Beitou Library is &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; from inside to outside! Part of the roof is covered in solar panels, which can store up to 16KW of power. The wooden balcony railing is also eco-friendly; its vertical design conserves energy by reducing the amount of heat-causing rays allowed to enter the rooms.

Ascending from in front of the Yangming University campus research building (about 800m away from MRT-Qilian station) takes around 30 minutes by means of a 500m-long stone stairway. A fork in the middle of this path offers the choice of paved and railed route to the right and natural sandstone to the left. The huge white rock on the top resembles a battleship, which is the origin of the name in Chinese. This offers magnificent views back over rural and urban Taipei. An alternative route, also by means of a 500m-long stairway, leaves from the MRT-Shipai station behind the Veteran General Hospital. Mid-altitude plants such as Pieris taiwanensis Hayata and rough-leaved holly are found alongside the path.Danfeng Mountain, at an elevation of 117m, is reached about 350m by a path that leaves from beside the General Chen Ji-tang Mausoleum on Qiyan Road in Old Beitou. The path continues up to Zhaominjing Temple, as does another that starts from Danfeng Heights at Lane 201, Qiyan Road. The temple, also called Lovers’ Temple is located on Chongyang 7th Road. Taking the southeasterly path from the temple, Junjianyan is about 1.2 kilometers away.Two other routes also lead to this spot, both starting at the Yangming Mountain First Cemetery located at the intersection of Xingyi Road and Quanyuan Road. From 220-12 Quanyuan Road, follow the uphill path inside the cemetery to a fork about 160m further on; the westerly route of Huangxi Mountain (281 meters above sea level) path runs about 1.1 kilometers to Junjianyan, the southerly route about 1.4 kilometers. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.geo.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=36796989&amp;ctNode=67793&amp;mp=106051</xurl><address>Beitou Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="The Junjianyan and Danfeng Area_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002799.jpg</img><img description="The Junjianyan and Danfeng Area_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002800.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.518937</longitude><latitude>25.127440</latitude><MRT>Qilian </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>57</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Bicycle Traces</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000026</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Left and Right Banks of the Jingmei River Bikeway</stitle><xbody>The bikeways along the left and right banks of the Jingmei wind through a picturesque setting of lush green hills and crystal clear water.

The showroom’s displayed items were relocated to the Lottery Bureau behind the present-day Presidential Office, and gave rise to the 1908 opening of Taiwan Viceroy’s Office Museum. During 1913, the Qing-dynasty Tianhou Temple in what is now the 228 Peace Memorial Park was torn down to make way for the “Viceroy Kodama Gentaro and Chief Civil Administrator Goto Shinpei Memorial Museum”, which was a new project intended to house the Taiwan Viceroy’s Office Museum collection. It was rechristened the “Museum of Taiwan Province” in 1945 and “Taiwan Provincial Museum” in 1949, before receiving its current title “National Taiwan Museum” in 1999.Sitting at the other end of Guanqian Road from Taipei Main Station, the National Taiwan Museum features a Grecian façade with towering columns, an acanthus leaves-embellished pediment and a domed hall accentuated by 32 columns, each with an ornate Corinthian capital, in addition to stained-glass skylights through which sunlight filters to cast dazzling patterns on the ground. While sentimentally bearing witness to Taiwan’s history, the Museum offers exhibitions as well as irregular events on a scale much unchanged since its founding.</xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2015/11/26</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://formosa.ntm.gov.tw/web/en/exhibition.aspx</xurl><address>Zhongzheng Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 2, Xiangyang Rd., Taipei</address><xpostDate>2015/11/26</xpostDate><file><img description="National Taiwan Museum_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000777.jpg</img><img description="National Taiwan Museum_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000778.jpg</img><img description="National Taiwan Museum_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000779.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station：MRT NTU Hospital Station Exit 4Bus:20、222、236、237、241、243、244、245、249、251、263、513、532、621、644、651、670、706、706</info><longitude>121.51501</longitude><latitude>25.04328</latitude><MRT>NTU Hospital </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>59</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Outing Locations</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000554</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Erge Mountain System: Xianjiyan Hiking Trail</stitle><xbody>lso called Jingmei Mountain after its location near the intersection of the Jingmei and Xindian rivers, the local people refer to it as Xizikou Mountain.

At 144m in height, Xianjiyan offers a gentle day out for family groups. Many trails ascend the hill, the most popular being the stairway of the monumental archway starting from next to No. 241, Jinxin St (#3 entrance on the map).

The main deity at the temple is the Thousand-hand Guanyin, the patron saint for health, marriage, illumination and wealth. Wax statues depicting the mythical lovers, the Cowherd and Weaving Girl are also placed at the temple, earning it the nickname of "Lover's Temple." Zhaojing Temple is also a popular spot for making a wish. Visitors can write their wishes on slips of paper or wood tablets and, after praying to the Thousand-hand Guanyin, place the paper slips in the wishing box next to the goddess. Visitors can then toss coins into the wishing pool by the temple, aiming for one of six earthen bowls representing marriage, health and wealth, depending on the nature of their wish. There is also a wishing pavilion where visitors can hang the wooden wish tablets. The inscription at the pavilion reads, "True love goes unseen, but false affections are known to heaven." It is a reminder for lovers to cherish their feelings and not be deceptive in love, and a wish that everyone will find their perfect match. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2011/05/18</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Beitou Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2011/05/18</xpostDate><file><img description="Zhaojing Temple -Lover's Temple_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000917.jpg</img><img description="Zhaojing Temple -Lover's Temple_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000918.jpg</img><img description="Zhaojing Temple -Lover's Temple_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000919.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.51378</longitude><latitude>25.13153</latitude><MRT>Qiyan</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>78</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000410</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TIME>Opening Hours: The house can only be viewed from the outside</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Tianmu White House </stitle><xbody>The White House in Tianmu was formerly used as the residence of U.S. military advisors based in Taiwan.

Due to his capable administration of Hui’an in Quanzhou, Fujian, Zhang was deified as "Qingshan Wang" or "Ling’an Zunwang." Since that time, Qingshan Wang has been worshipped as a god with the power to dispel disease and a divine authority of justice, rewarding virtue and punishing evil. He is revered along with the Eight Justice deities, including General Jia and General Suo. The Bangka Qingshan Temple was built over a century ago. The temple is arranged in a three-courtyard layout, with buildings made of wood and stone. The temple has been well maintained over the years and continues to greet visitors with its abundant charms, including a beautiful octagonal plafond. The stone columns and buttresses are carved of stone from the old Yuanshan Shinto Shrine.

Huiji Temple was built in dedication to the god at Zishanyan in 1752. Later, when Guanyin was worshiped here as well, the temple was also known as Zhishanyan Temple.

Mr. Lin did not only translate the word “humor” into Chinese, but also promoted literature of humor. Famous for being a modern Chinese scholar writing in English, Mr. Lin was a linguist, philosopher, man of letters, traveler and creator.   In 1966, Mr. Lin returned and resided in Taiwan. Designed by Mr. Lin, this house integrates the style of Chinese four-chamber architecture and Western aesthetics. With blue tiles and white walls, arches and winding corridors, this house manifests the beauty of classical architecture. As to its site on Yangmingshan, it resembles his hometown in Fujian. When he was still alive, he could hear the dialect he was familiar with – Southern Fujianese, from time to time, giving him the feel of home.Once he described this house saying, “there is a yard in the mansion; house in the yard; garden in the house. There are trees in the garden, sky upon the trees and moon upon the sky. How marvelous it is.” Mr. Lin always came to the balcony. After dinner, he loved to sit on a rattan armchair smoking his pipe. Watching the sunset at Guanyin Mountain, you can also feel Mr. Lin’s serenity. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2014/03/25</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.linyutang.org.tw/english/index.asp</xurl><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei City111, Section 2, Yangde Boulevard, Shilin District, Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2014/03/25</xpostDate><file><img description="The Lin Yutang House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000389.jpg</img><img description="The Lin Yutang House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000390.jpg</img><img description="The Lin Yutang House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000391.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>1.Buses: Take 260, 303, S15, S16, S17, or Red 5 and get off at Yongfu (Lin Yutang House) station. 2.Parking: Small parking lot opposite to Lin Yutang House 3.Traffic control: Small cars are prohibited at Yangmingshan on holidays from 7:00am to 3:00pm.

Before the road's completion, worshipers had to climb the mountain trails, and the 1200 steps bounded by aged trees are still a popular means of making a pilgrimage to Zhinan Temple. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.geo.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=37483613&amp;ctNode=67820&amp;mp=106051</xurl><address>Wenshan Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Zhinan Temple Area_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001476.jpg</img><img description="Zhinan Temple Area_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001477.jpg</img><img description="Zhinan Temple Area_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002823.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.583663</longitude><latitude>24.976283</latitude><MRT>Taipei Zoo </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>93</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Religious Venues</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000305</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2880-2972</MEMO_TEL><stitle>Cixian Temple</stitle><xbody>Shilin Cixian Temple (also called Shilin Mazu Temple) is dedicated to the goddess Mazu. Originally known as Tianhou Temple, it was built in 1796 with funding from a local merchant named He Chin-tang at the site of the present-day Shilin Tourist Night Market. The temple was destroyed in a fire that engulfed Zhilan Street during a fight between rival immigrant clans from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in mainland China. Through the efforts of Pan Yung-ching, a member of the local gentry, the street was rebuilt at Xiashulin, known today as Shilin New Street. Cixian Temple was subsequently built at the center of this new street.   Cixian Temple consists of two halls, two galleries and two wings that together form five courtyards. The two halls are linked by a gallery in a style typical of southern Fujian temple architecture. The Sanchuan Hall in the front part of the temple is covered by a double-eaved gable and hip roof with a swallowtailed ridge in the style of a "Taizi Tower". The central door to the main hall is flanked by octagonal columns carved with coiling dragons dating to the Guangxu period (1875 to 1908). The left and right carved kylins were made in 1828. The exquisite paintings of the Palace Maiden and the door gods Wei Chi-kung and Chin Shu-pao are among the other artistic attractions at the temple. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2011/05/18</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2011/05/18</xpostDate><file><img description="Cixian Temple_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000937.jpg</img><img description="Cixian Temple_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000938.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.524926</longitude><latitude>25.089562</latitude><MRT>Jiantan </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>94</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Art and Culture Centers</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000167</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2391-9393</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_FAX>2391-9393</MEMO_FAX><MEMO_TIME>Tue-Sun. 10:00-22:00, closed on Monday</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Guling Street Avant-Garde Theater</stitle><xbody>Housed in the former Zhongzheng Second Precinct building, this intimate theater occupies an important place in Taipei's theater world.

The keel-inspired bridge stretches from the Dragon Boat Rock in the east to Yuanjue Waterfall in the west, connecting four mountains (Baishihu, Daluntou, Zhongyong and Liyu) along the way as if it were a gigantic dragon watching over the scenic Baishihu. The Baishihu Suspension Bridge features a straight abutment, rather than the towering ones commonly found at similar bridges, which gives it a cable-less and “invisible” style that blends perfectly with the idyllic surroundings. The Baishihu Community on the other side of the bridge boasts a 100-meter Chunqiu Footpath that greets visitors with an ingeniously and professionally engineered horticultural area, besides the unique scenic and ecological resources of farms that produce organic vegetables and strawberries. Areas around the suspension bridge, including the temple yards, orchards, forest footpath and the lake-strewn wetland, provide terrific places to enjoy blooming flowers and chirping birds. Art workshops and handicraft clinics are also hosted by community elders to pass on Baishihu’s legacy </xbody><avBegin>2012/06/20</avBegin><avEnd>2012/06/20</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Neihu Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 24, Bishan Rd.</address><xpostDate>2012/06/20</xpostDate><file><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D32/E269/F452/4548e09c-1a7c-4e67-9513-5f1099af7d52.jpg</img><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F359/a14b8f79-93e2-40d3-933b-dcd7c0a08c35.jpg</img><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D28/E449/F570/b9461d63-1284-44ab-8893-6d35c578461c.jpg</img><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D10/E464/F550/cbabc739-12b0-42c3-bcc0-a76ce10918cd.jpg</img><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D16/E15/F92/c2e555df-ece4-40e4-8c46-104983d498f7.jpg</img><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D7/E56/F946/08cd45e5-8a58-4c6d-8225-c27570e9a875.jpg</img><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D23/E574/F70/9de4bb78-346b-4ddf-b719-7ce6f76546ba.jpg</img><img description="Baishihu Suspension Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D32/E671/F746/e8c24748-bcbc-446e-adec-9e139b038a68.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>From the MRT Neihu Station (Exit 1), walk toward the Yentou Earth God Temple (No. 452, Sec. 2, Neihu Rd.) and then take the Mini Bus No. 2 from there.1.

They chose this area for its moist mountain climate, which was well suited for growing tea. They also brought their local gods, including Baoyi Zunwang, Baoyi Dafu and Qingshui Zushi. At that time, the settlers came mainly from three clans: the Kaos, Changs and Lins. As their numbers grew, the wilderness receded to cultivated land extending from Jingmei to Muzha, Shenkeng and Shiding. The gods also joined in this migration with the establishment of three temples, one of which is the Jiying Temple at Jingmei Market, established by the Kao clan. Located in the old part of Jingmei, Jiying Temple is designated as a grade three historic site. The temple is imposing both inside and out, with elaborate stone engravings, wooden window frames and other decorative touches adding to its old-world charm. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2013/04/03</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wenshan Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 37, Jingmei St., Wenshan Dist., Taipei City 116</address><xpostDate>2013/04/03</xpostDate><file><img description="Jiying Temple in Jingmei_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000953.jpg</img><img description="Jiying Temple in Jingmei_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001955.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station：From Jingmei Station walk about 5 minutes to the temple1.

Some say that the fifth gate&amp;mdash;Xiaonanmen (Little South Gate)&amp;mdash;was built especially for the convenience of the family of local tycoon Lin Pen-yuan in Banqiao, though this has never been proved. Whatever the facts, Xiaonanmen is indeed a unique case. The gate was unfortunately destroyed by the Japanese along with the East Gate and South Gate, but after World War II it was rebuilt as a city wall tower in a northern Chinese palace style.

The temple continued to serve an educational role through the Japanese occupation period. Scholarships for public schools were awarded at the temple during annual ceremonies to encourage academic achievement. A separate Shuren Academy was later built at Wenchang Temple on Dihua Street Section 2 in Taipei City. During the school examination period, students flock to the temple to make offerings of foods with symbolic meaning, such as tangerines (good luck), scallions (intelligence and skill), kumquats (examination success), turnips (good fortune), and sweet osmanthus leaves (assistance from persons of noble standing).   Wenchang Temple also occupies an important place in the history of Dalongdong as the origin of the local public school system and a memorial to the educational spirit of the early residents of this area. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2011/05/18</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Datong Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2011/05/18</xpostDate><file><img description="Wenchang Temple_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000927.jpg</img><img description="Wenchang Temple_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000928.jpg</img><img description="Wenchang Temple_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000929.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.512064</longitude><latitude>25.073000</latitude><MRT>Yuanshan </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>107</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Art and Culture Centers</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000101</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-6610-1234</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_COST>Science Exhibit (3-6F) NT$100(Concession NT$70), 3DTheater NT$100 (Concession NT$70), 4D Theater NT$100 (Concession NT$70), SkyCycle NT$80(Concession NT$50)</MEMO_COST><MEMO_TIME>Weekends, national holidays, and winter/summer holidays: 09:00~18:00 (admission to 17:00); Tues~Fri (except during winter and summer holidays): 09:00~17:00 (admission to 16:00); Closed on Mondays (except during winter and summer holidays)</MEMO_TIME><stitle>National Taiwan Science Education Center </stitle><xbody>The National Taiwan Science Education Center is a great place to learn about science, regardless of your age.

The premises were one of Taiwan’s pioneers of modern industry, as well as the first professional tobacco plant. A gracefully simple Japanese modernist structure, the factory features meticulously crafted face cams, glasswork and bronze nails that made it arguably a “model factory” at that time. When Japan lost the war in 1945, the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau took over the factory and renamed it, Songshan Tobacco Factory of Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau. The factory ceased production of cigarettes in 1998 for concerns over urban planning, regulatory changes in the tobacco and liquor marketing system, as well as shrinking demand. It became a relic of the past after being merged into the Taipei Cigarette Plant. In 2001, the Taipei City Government named the tobacco factory the city’s 99th historic site and converted it into a park comprising city-designated historic sites (namely the office building, the 1st to 5th warehouses, cigarette plant and boiler room), historic structures (the inspection room, a machinery repair shed and a nursing room) and architectural highlights (the Baroque-style garden, an ecologically landscaped pond, a public bath and a multi-purpose auditorium). For more efficient reuse of space, the Songshan Cultural and Creative Park was built on the historic site as a production base for designers and cultural &amp; creative businesses, as well as a venue for performances and exhibitions. The park introduced to its premises a Taiwan Design Museum and TMSK through partnerships with the Taiwan Design Center and prestigious Taiwanese glasswork label LIULI GONG FANG, respectively, besides a snack bar that was converted from the machinery repair shed. </xbody><avBegin>2012/06/20</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/05</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.songshanculturalpark.org/en/index.html</xurl><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 133, Guangfu S.

The temple rises four floors and is built in a traditional Chinese palace-style with white outer railings and vermilion pillars adding to its stately appearance. It is said that during the temple's construction, workers worked hard but unsuccessfully to dig a well. Later a water source was found behind the temple purportedly with divine guidance, earning the temple site designation as sacred ground. The spring flows with clear sweet water that is well suited for making tea.Adherents of I-Kuan Tao worship both eastern and western gods and this eclectic spirit is also reflected in the temple. In addition to the statue of the movement founder, visitors will see the Maitreya Buddha, smiling gaily without worries in the main hall, with Guanyin (Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva) and the Taoist deity Guan Gong (Guan Sheng Di Jun) on the two sides. The temple often holds classes for spiritual cultivation and moral guidance and scripture classes for children. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2011/05/18</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wenshan Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 37-2, Ln. 38, Sec. 3, Zhinan Rd., Wenshan Dist., Taipei City 116</address><xpostDate>2011/05/18</xpostDate><file><img description="Tian'en Temple_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001952.jpg</img><img description="Tian'en Temple_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001953.jpg</img><img description="Tian'en Temple_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001954.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station：From Wanfang Community Station take the M10 bus to Maokong Station or Maokong.1.

The lake referred to was said to be inhabited by a malevolent water sprite who stirred up waves that killed countless people over the years. One day, while passing by the lake with his troops, Cheng hurled a jeweled sword at the water sprite, killing the beast and calming the waters.  Historic records of the Tamsui Prefectural Government indicate that Jiantan Temple was built in Jiantan in 1773 with funds donated by Wu Ting-kao and other patrons. The records also note that a plaque at the temple recounts a story, in which the Monk Wanhua came across a snake blocking the road while traveling through the area. The monk divined this to be an auspicious incident, and therefore ordered a temple to be built on the spot. He later had a dream instructing him the eight ships from Shanghai would pass by Keelung, providing funds to build the temple. The temple was constructed on the designated spot, but was moved during the later part of the Japanese occupation period to its current location. At the front of the temple stands a monumental arch with a green-tile roof, below which is an inscription of the temple's name. The narrow lane inside is the original site of the temple, and in the wooded garden here one can still see the original age-worn temple columns and stela. </xbody><avBegin>2011/05/18</avBegin><avEnd>2012/10/09</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongshan Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2012/10/09</xpostDate><file><img description="Jiantan Temple_1">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000939.jpg</img><img description="Jiantan Temple_2">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000940.jpg</img><img description="Jiantan Temple_3">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000941.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.555320</longitude><latitude>25.086228</latitude><MRT>Jiannan Rd.</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>113</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Art and Culture Centers</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000257</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2652-3180</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_FAX>2786-8834</MEMO_FAX><MEMO_TIME>Wed &amp; Sat 9:30-16:30 (Closed during national holidays and on certain designated days)</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Museum of the Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica</stitle><xbody>This research-focused museum houses an extensive collection of archeological artifacts from mainland China and Taiwan, opening a window to the early history and culture of both sides.

These somewhat crowded buildings chronicled the tears and joy of veterans who migrated to Taiwan in the early days. This is the former site of Taipei City’s Military Dependents’ Village, called the “Sisinan Village”. With the increasingly fast economic growth and the rising living standard, these old houses no longer serve the needs of the residents. The City Government initially planned to rebuild them in 1999. However, through persuasion from the cultural circles, the City Government designated this premise as the Cultural Hall and Cultural Park of Xinyi District, and started operation in 2003. The Hall consists of four symmetrical buildings. The houses that sat tightly next to each other have been converted into an open space for events and exhibitions. The premise now consists of an exhibition hall, Military Dependents’ Village Exhibition Hall, performance hall and community hall. The exterior still retains the unique low-rise and the simple, rustic style of the Military Dependents’ Village. The narrow alleys and footpaths will take the visitors down memory lane. It is a fascinating contrast to the neighboring towering Taipei 101 and surrounding modern buildings, a compelling testimony of Taipei’s urban development.</xbody><avBegin>2011/11/12</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei CityNo.50, Songqin Street</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D348/E414/F440/286458f4-dae6-45c3-8327-297e39e037ad.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D321/E663/F664/7fd52535-f6d1-46d2-9737-5f2da3620708.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D123/E105/F467/d0eb5cdf-d526-439d-abfd-132f5853394d.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D980/E64/F268/eb69cc8f-6de4-474a-b149-382d83d79d3f.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D211/E19/F637/4e7bcc71-010c-410f-adcb-95825e047444.JPG</img><img description="Xinyi Assembly Hall, Taipei City">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000796.jpg</img><img description="Xinyi Assembly Hall, Taipei City">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000797.jpg</img><img description="Xinyi Assembly Hall, Taipei City">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000798.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>1.By Bus: Take Bus No. 202 (sub-line), 207, 647, 650, or Xinyi Main Line, and alight at Xinyi District Administrative Center Stop; or take Bus No. 1, 22, 33, 37, 38, 226, 265, 266, 288, or Blue 5, and get off at Jinxin Village Stop; or take Bus No. 20, 22, 33, 37, 38, 226, 292, or Xinyi Main Line, and alight at Xinyi-Guangfu Intersection Stop.</info><longitude>121.56197</longitude><latitude>25.03131</latitude><MRT>Taipei 101/World Trade Center</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>115</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>For the whole family</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011051800000229</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-8866-6258</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_FAX>8866-6257</MEMO_FAX><MEMO_TIME>Tues~Sun 09:00-17:00 (Last admission at 16:30); Closed on Mondays and during the Lunar New Year holiday</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Zhishan Cultural and Ecological Garden (Zhishan Exhibition Hall)</stitle><xbody>Zhishanyan is archeological site where human remains dating back 2,500 years were excavated.

As the second half of the previous Yulu Historic Trail, the Tianmu Historic Trail comprises several footpaths that connect Huagang and Tianmu along a water main. These footpaths are perfect for a refreshing summer hike with the murmuring creek running through a pristine forest nearby. People who seek cool, tree-shaded trails may as well take the Cuifeng Trail and stop by Cuifeng Waterfall before reaching Houdong Industrial Road.  Once a major transportation corridor between Jinshan and Tianmu, the Tianmu Historic Trail has literally become an “old trail” since the inauguration of Yangde Blvd. and, in recent years, has been crowded with sightseers every weekend.   Ecological phenomena along the Tianmu Historic TrailAt an altitude of 300 to 120 meters, Tianmu Historic Trail features a broadleaf forest ecosystem typical of the low-altitude, subtropical Taiwan. Northeastern monsoons and the attendant gales, rainfall and low temperatures coming from the saddle of Datun Mountain helped to create a warm-temperate broadleaf forest along the trail on the windward hillside. The shady and humid valley on the leeward side, nevertheless, encourages the growth of tropical broadleaf trees and such tropical phenomena as the buttress roots, cauliflory, and Strangling plants. Although the trail is located only at 300 meters above sea level, it boasts a rarely-seen, compact ecosystem that simultaneously comprises broadleaf forests of tropical, subtropical and warm-temperate biomes.   ◎Warning for hikers: When you reach a fork in the path leading downward toward Cuifeng Waterfall, do NOT feed the monkeys that frequently show up in groups because they may hurt you while fighting for food!</xbody><avBegin>2011/11/13</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.geo.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=37196244&amp;ctNode=67798&amp;mp=106051</xurl><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei CityLane 12, Aifu 3rd Street</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Qixing Mountain System: Old Tianmu Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000377.jpg</img><img description="Qixing Mountain System: Old Tianmu Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000378.jpg</img><img description="Qixing Mountain System: Old Tianmu Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000379.jpg</img><img description="Qixing Mountain System: Old Tianmu Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/10002979.jpg</img><img description="Qixing Mountain System: Old Tianmu Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/10002980.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>By MRT: Get off at MRT Shipai Station and change to Bus Red 15, Red 19 or No. 224, alight at Tianmu Stop1.

Entering from Xiangshan Trail near Lingyun Temple, the path is paved with stones, marked with indicators and surrounded by Taiwan acacia (Acacia confuse). Along the path are numerous shelters and seats donated by Zaojuehui (Morning Exercise Club) that provide resting locations for mountain hikers. The trial is connected to Xiangshan, Hushan and Lishanqiaokou.  Nangang MountainDaying PavilionNangang Mountain is located at the intersecting ridge of Xinyi District and Nangang District, and is the highest peak among the Nangang Mountains. On its peak are a glistering lamp and an equilateral triangle No. 695. The 196 m tall Nangang Mountain spans from Changshou Park to Muzhi Mountain, and provides great paths and trails for those who like to hike. At the peak, you’ll see four smaller mountains shaped like an elephant, a lion, a leopard and a tiger to the northwest, thus the name Sishou (“Four Beasts”) Mountains. An endless stream of mountains rises and falls to the east and south. There is a television broadcast antenna at the highest point of Nangang Mountain, with nearby ridges having sharp differences in altitude. One of the peaks is known as the “95 Peak”, so named after General Yang Sen, who conquered this peak at the ripe age of 95.A serene, peaceful trailXiangshan (Mt. Elephant) and Hushan (Mt. Tiger) belong to the same mountain series, but their sceneries are not as diverse as here. The later section of the trail is more tranquil with richer forest ecology than the Hushan Trail. Further down, the murmuring sound of creek and archaic bridge enhance the placid ambiance.</xbody><avBegin>2011/11/13</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.geo.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=37483064&amp;ctNode=67812&amp;mp=106051</xurl><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei CityNangang Mountain</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Nangang Mountain System: Nangangshan Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002068.jpg</img><img description="Nangang Mountain System: Nangangshan Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002069.jpg</img><img description="Nangang Mountain System: Nangangshan Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002070.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station: Alight at Kunyang Station and take Bus S1, S12 or Blue 25 to China University of Science and Technology Stop.By Bus: Take Bus No. 1, 22, 32, 37, 38, 226, 288, 503 or 266 and alight at Wuxing Elementary School Stop.

Nestled by the Shilin Bridge, Kuo’s century-old family business was successfully revamped as a “historic pastry brand” by the 4 generations of owners. To preserve the prestigious brand’s historic assets accumulated over 100 years, Mr. Kuo founded Taiwan’s first pastry museum, offering further insight into how the Taiwanese pastry and ceremonial customs have evolved over the span of time. One year after the Yangmei museum was launched in 2001, Kuo Yuan Ye converted the 4th and 5th floors of its Shilin headquarters into “Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake &amp; Pastry”. Not only are the history of Taiwanese pastry and ceremonial traditions shown in an exhibit area, but the museum also offers hands-on baking experiences at the Joy Bakery and family-friendly events both in-and out-doors, in the hope that people of all ages will love and appreciate the art of Taiwanese pastry.  </xbody><avBegin>2012/03/14</avBegin><avEnd>2012/03/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei City4 &amp; 5F, No. 546, Wenlin Rd.</address><xpostDate>2012/03/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F315/1f56cbde-dc49-43cd-9063-cf333092b02d.JPG</img><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F316/0b7025bd-7db3-4255-b684-1a3e271cd23e.JPG</img><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F317/993e706e-6a9f-4fd1-8996-17196684e8b2.JPG</img><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F318/eea1cf7f-2e70-4172-94f2-fc6dc4b2fa88.JPG</img><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D2/E759/F711/4e3169c3-a1e8-4906-ab14-578e22b835dd.jpg</img><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D3/E76/F439/b2b8bbf7-fa5b-4506-a81c-83181320ce0a.jpg</img><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D2/E537/F856/147abd8a-12eb-41e7-8e27-434c4b56344f.jpg</img><img description="Kuo Yuan Ye Museum of Cake and Pastry">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D27/E966/F434/78ad76ec-16f1-414c-a6f5-ef96e7be495a.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT: Get off at Shilin Station and follow the road under the elevated bridge or take the overpass at Wenlin-Zhongzheng intersection in the direction of Shilin Bridge for approx. 200 m.1.

In 1967, Mr. Ch’ien built this house in Waishuangxi and named it after the Wuxi (China) family estate where his mother lived. At the Ch’ien Mu House, every detail of the garden, such as the footpath lined with maple trees and rows of bamboo, is a result of years of tireless horticultural efforts by Mrs. Ch’ien. Mr. Ch’ien was constantly giving lectures in Taiwan and has attracted a loyal group of followers, including college professors, who have visited the Sushu Building for 20 consecutive years along with their students on outings. An empowering and charismatic speaker, Mr. Ch’ien impressed his ever-packed audience with the amazing nuances of Chinese culture. A few months after moving out of his 22-year residence at age 96, Mr. Ch’ien died; the Sushu Building was left untended for years until it was reopened on Jan. 6, 1992 by the Taipei Public Library as a memorial hall. It was then renovated by the city government in 2001. Taipei City’s Department of Cultural Affairs renamed Sushu Building on Dec. 31, 2001 as “The Ch’ien Mu House” and handed it over to Soochow University for management. It was succeeded by the Taipei Municipal University of Education on Jan. 1, 2011.</xbody><avBegin>2012/02/24</avBegin><avEnd>2015/08/17</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 72, Linxi Rd.</address><xpostDate>2015/08/17</xpostDate><file><img description="The Ch’ien Mu House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E196/F339/9a1bb72f-40dd-4241-864a-727090f7f65a.JPG</img><img description="The Ch’ien Mu House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E196/F340/a40b3f4a-db59-493e-9c71-16485e916015.JPG</img><img description="The Ch’ien Mu House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E196/F341/d5ea4261-7231-4fdf-9bb8-aeea86b43103.JPG</img><img description="The Ch’ien Mu House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F987/ad4665b2-ade0-45be-82f1-c946d1bb2a30.JPG</img><img description="The Ch’ien Mu House">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F988/377e9cbf-374d-4de7-b821-88bdc9b7302a.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Mass transit systems: From MRT Shilin Station (Zhongzheng Rd. exit): take bus No. 304, Red 30, 255, 620, Minibus 18 or Minibus 19 to Soochow University; head straight from the main gate of the university to reach the Ch’ien Mu House.Others: Parking arrangement is available for cars and tour buses with advance notice. </info><longitude>121.546321</longitude><latitude>25.094283</latitude><MRT>Shilin  </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>129</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2012010900000004</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Old storefront buildings on Dihua St.</stitle><xbody>Bangka (Monga) was the first port in Taipei before the once-massive Tamsui River was silted up due to the upper-stream settlements. After losing an ethnic clash (i.e., Ding-Xia-Jiao-Ping) in 1853, immigrants from Fujian’s Tongan region were forced out of Bangka by the Sanyi immigrants, also from Fujian, to settle in Dadaocheng. As the trade input between China and the West reached a record high, Dadaocheng replaced the inaccessible Bangka as a major port and prosperous business district. Stores selling goods from China mushroomed along Dihua Street, which is situated behind the riverfront-facing Guide Street. Overnight, wealth prompted the Dihua Street-based businessmen to erect opulent houses with arcades adapted to the rainy climate. In addition to the intriguing eclectic facades that are decorated in Western style, these old storefront houses are best known for being extremely narrow and deep. Behind each storefront is a factory or a warehouse, lending an air of distinction to this cluster of old-fashioned housing complex.</xbody><avBegin>2012/01/09</avBegin><avEnd>2014/09/02</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Datong Dist.,Taipei CitySection 1, Dihua St.</address><xpostDate>2014/09/02</xpostDate><file><img description="Old storefront buildings on Dihua St.">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000909.jpg</img><img description="Old storefront buildings on Dihua St.">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000910.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT: Approx. 10 min walk from Shuanglian Station Bus: 39, 272 - alight at Dadaocheng Stop (approx. 3 min walk); 9, 206, 255, 274, 302, 304 - alight at Nanjing W.

Their altitudes are 325, 223 and 290 meters, respectively. Zhongyong Mountain is the largest ridge of Wuzhi Mountain, and is a typical pointed-shape mountain. Liyu Mountain is high at one end and low on the end, making it shaped like a carp. Yuanjuejian Mountain is smaller, and derives its name from the Yuanjue Temple at its hillside. Zhongyong Mountain &amp; Liyu Mountain Trail The Zhongyong Mountain and Liyu Mountain Trail begin at the Dahu Villa Stop in Neihu. Along the trail are several famous temples. There is also the elegant Yuanjue Waterfall. At a high altitude, you will have an unobstructed and magnificent view of Taipei City. The trail is accompanied by the serene flow of Dagou Creek, and the wood-made path serves as a complement to the river and forest. As one traverses further down the trail, the forest becomes denser; flowers and the singing of colorful birds create an aura of excitement. At the end of the trail is Jinlong Temple, and with the “escort” of the Eighteen Arhats, this wonderful journey will soon end. Zhongyong Mountain There is a bronze statue of Chiang Kai-shek at the peak of the mountain. Starting from Jinlong Temple, the trail is rocky and steep, similar to a Hero Slope. The journey will require more stamina and is more challenging. Liyu Mountain Liyu Mountain is located at the south-eastern side of Zhongyong Mountain and the two mountains are connected. Its name is derived from its head-high and tail-low shape, which resembles a carp. Some people also called it the Xiaokengjian Mountain.

It is 140 meters above sea level and forms a natural barrier at Taipei City’s southeastern section. The terrain is high on the west and low on the east, and on its peak is a sundial for observing the movement of the sun. The path is paved with sandstone and shale. Hushan River passes through the mountain, and forms an excellent natural habitat for the nurturing of fireflies, frogs and diversified life forms, making this trail the best spot for observing a wetland natural habitat. Along the path are also clear indicators and maps. This is an ideal place for both hiking and ecological observation.Sishou Mountain Citizen Forest   The Sishou Mountain Trail was renamed Sishou Mountain Citizen Forest after having undergone renovation.

It is situated behind the Grand Hotel and is also the hill nearest to the City center. The trail along the ridge will also lead to the other mountains. It is an easy and relaxing trail for hikers to take in the panoramic views of the city, and it is accessible via a variety of public transportation means. Jiantan Mountain Trail The entrance to the mountain is located at Sec. 4 of Zhongshan N. Rd. near MRT Jiantan Station. This was once a military control zone and also a conservation area; thus, its natural habitat and ecology are well preserved. In addition, numerous manually cultivated plants can be seen along the trail, enriching it with greenness and vitality. This trail has become a popular venue for nearby residents doing their morning exercises. The “Old Place” for instance, is one of those famous “exercise spots”. Along the trail, one can see the Grand Hotel and Keelung Riverside Park. At the end of this easy-to-traverse trail you’ll come out at Lane 165 of Tongbei Rd., near Beian Rd. intersection. Beautiful Night Scenes from Jiantan Mountain The night scenery of Jiantan Mountain Trail has always been popular, and not without reason. Located at a high altitude in the midst of a bustling city, coupled with airplanes flying low across the night sky above, the ambience it generates always creates excitement and anticipation; the place has thus become a popular hangout for young couples and students. What adds to the allure, are the delicacies of Shilin Night Market, and it is no wonder that the trail has more hikers during the nighttime than daytime! </xbody><avBegin>2011/10/27</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.geo.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=37197847&amp;ctNode=67804&amp;mp=106051</xurl><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei CityLane 400, Beian Rd.</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Wuzhi Mountain System: Jiantanshan Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001470.jpg</img><img description="Wuzhi Mountain System: Jiantanshan Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001471.jpg</img><img description="Wuzhi Mountain System: Jiantanshan Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11001472.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station: Get off at Jiantan Station and head toward the trail entrance near Jiantan bus stop1.

There are five historic city gates in Taipei: the East Gate (Jingfu Gate), West Gate (Baocheng Gate), South Gate (Lizheng Gate), Lesser South Gate (Chongxi Gate) and North Gate (Cheng’en Gate). They were built by Liu Ming-chuan during the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty as a measure to expedite urban development by encouraging businessmen to invest in or build houses/streets in Taipei City. Also known as Cheng’en Gate, the North Gate in erstwhile Taipei City served as a major gateway to Dadaocheng. The two-story fortress of North Gate is enclosed by sturdy walls in the form of a highly guarded citadel. For surveillance and defense reasons, the square- and round-shaped window openings on the front and back of fortress are the only two features on the second floor. Similar to the East Gate, the North Gate in its inception had a small enclosure on the outside, commonly referred to as “urn city”, or “Wong Cheng” in Chinese. There used to be a horizontal plaque saying “The Key to Territory Safety” which had hung across the gate. The plaque was unfortunately removed by Japanese colonial rulers and is now located on the empty lot in front of the North Gate for display. In light of the emerging trend of cultural heritage preservation in recent years, the city authorities decided to abandon a demolition plan of the historic North Gate. Of the five ancient city gates, the North Gate is the only one that remains what it used to look like in the Qing Dynasty, as well as one of the most valuable state-designated historic sites in Taipei. </xbody><avBegin>2011/10/27</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongzheng Dist.,Taipei CitySection 1, Zhongxiao West Road</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Taipei City Wall-North Gate (Cheng'en Gate)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000875.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>By MRT: Get off at Taipei Main Station and walk for 10 minutes along Zhongxiao West Road.1.

In 1901, Taiwan Governor’s Office consolidated the Taiwan Pharmaceutical Factory, Taiwan Salt Bureau and Taiwan Camphor Bureau into the “Monopoly Bureau of the Taiwan Governor’s Office”, marking an important beginning of the monopoly system. Before the Retrocession of Taiwan, the eight commodities included in the monopoly system were: tobacco, liquor, opium, salt, camphor, matches, petroleum and measuring instruments. The building was constructed in 1913 to cater to the voluminous workload of the monopoly system. It was designed by an engineer of the Construction and Maintenance Division of the Taiwan Governor Office, Matsunosuke Moriyama (1870 -1949) and was completed in 1922. The architectural style is similar to that of the Presidential Office, and it became the model structure that was copied after by other elites architectural projects at that time. The building features an L-shaped floor layout and there is a semi-circular gable at the facade. The foyer has a spherical roof top and the façade; both the right and left wings feature a column-style design, giving the exterior of the building a rich and grandiose look. After the Retrocession of Taiwan, the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Executive Office, in an effort to maintain its financial resources and minimize the taxpayers’ burden, decided to continue the monopoly system. The organization was restructured as “the Taiwan Province Monopoly Bureau”, with the number of monopolized items down to five: tobacco, liquor, camphor, matches and measuring instruments. By 1968, the two items that remained in the monopoly system were tobacco and liquor. </xbody><avBegin>2011/11/13</avBegin><avEnd>2012/01/16</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongzheng Dist.,Taipei CityNo.4, Section 1, Nanchang Road</address><xpostDate>2012/01/16</xpostDate><file><img description="Tobacco and Liquor Monopoly Bureau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000892.jpg</img><img description="Tobacco and Liquor Monopoly Bureau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000893.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>By MRT: 5 minute walk to Nanchang Road from Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall StationBy Bus: Take Bus No. 5, 204, 204 (shuttle), 227, 235, 241, 244, 295, 532, 630, 662, or 663, and alight at Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Bureau Stop</info><longitude>121.51488</longitude><latitude>25.03407</latitude><MRT>Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>136</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2012031400000003</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2862-2404</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_TIME>Dining services available 11AM- 9PM, Tue – Sun

When China’s Nationalist Government relocated to Taiwan in 1949, the then-President Chiang Kai-shek moved into the quiet Grass Mountain Chateau, previously a guest house of Taiwan Sugar Company. Perched strategically on the mountaintop, the chateau commands a view of such natural phenomena as the Guandu Plain, Shezidao and Mt. Guanyin. Grass Mountain was renamed as Yangmingshan in 1950 in memory of the great philosopher Wang Yang-ming. The 4,275 m2 Chateau has a Japanese-style main parlor which was common in the 1920s. Occupying an area of 584 m2 with aged trees by its gate, the main parlor is an embodiment of nostalgia that consists of the hallway, lobby, reception room, study room, bedroom, master bedroom, living room, guest room, kitchen, atrium, balcony, etc. The four smaller structures surrounding the main parlor, which had been the dormitories of Mr. Chiang’s bodyguards, were converted by the city government into artists’ studios as part of an aesthetic space. Eventually, those visiting the chateau will be able to engage themselves in unobstructed dialogues concerning ecology, culture and arts. </xbody><avBegin>2012/03/14</avBegin><avEnd>2014/08/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Beitou Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 89, Hudi Rd.</address><xpostDate>2014/08/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Grass Mountain Chateau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D19/E533/F732/ff73a05a-5dac-4c02-a653-88d4cbc9645b.JPG</img><img description="The heart-warming nightscape observed from Grass Mountain Chateau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E230/F819/b27d8356-0eed-43fb-9fe3-52be66ed1896.jpg</img><img description="Grass Mountain Chateau Arts and Cultural Center">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D33/E49/F120/cc026165-8262-4a13-9b82-221da51ee763.jpg</img><img description="The “Chiang Kai-shek’s Secret Menu: Lion’s Head” and “Mountain Delicacies”, based on locally produced ingredients, are must-eats.">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D30/E788/F475/c2426d77-07a8-4468-9758-de0aac360024.jpg</img><img description="Floor plan of Grass Mountain Chateau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E242/F894/fb3f3cd9-8a7b-4899-af42-33ba9d3d2b2a.jpg</img><img description="Grass Mountain Chateau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D29/E362/F237/c23808e9-829d-41f2-b427-4d2e34170c1c.jpg</img><img description="Grass Mountain Chateau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D32/E643/F178/0dc6f581-6222-4be9-9f4f-49370a52586f.jpg</img><img description="Grass Mountain Chateau">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D12/E843/F44/5ab65ac1-6f32-4dc8-8672-a7e76f749595.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT:1.

It is surprising that the distance from the MRT station to the skyline-viewing area is not at all intimidating, thanks to the extraordinary scenery that is revealed with each step toward higher altitudes. Popping up upon entering the skyline-viewing area is a secluded, tree-shaded mountain trail in a primitive forest. While rock and broken trunks scattered by the trailside add to the thrills of adventure, don’t forget to hold onto the rope and heed loose rocks on the steep trail, which is a poplar walking exercise spot in the neighborhood.  Having climbed 2,500 meters uphill, including the skyline-viewing trail with occasionally high gradients, people love to catch their breath on the vast mountaintop platform, watching egrets hanging around a huge cemetery, while getting ready for the challenges ahead.  Not only are stone steps built throughout the downhill footpath to make it more manageable, but hikers looking for some extra fun are also offered two optional routes. Those who feel hungry after their workout should stop by an organic farm on the left route for a vegetarian meal, besides a Kung Fu practice session and a shopping spree for fresh produce.  Those who take the right route will be greeted with the ＂back gardenof Xingtian Temple, known for its refreshing shaded tracks. The garden boasts intricate roots of aged Banyan trees, a common sight in the garden that never fails to amaze city dwellers, as well as pavilions that are popular rest stops for the exhausted temple-goers.

The current Chen Tian-lai Residence at No. 73, Gui’de Street used to house the former Jinji Tea Co. This three-story Baroque structure was completed in 1920 with the first floor dedicated to tea trading, the second floor serving as a guesthouse for tea-traders, and the third floor as private residence. The main structure of this imposing European-style house, flanked by guard towers on both sides, as well as classic colonnade and arched hallway, is adorned with baroque details as festoons and balconies.

Behind the Residence, a private garden adjacent to Gang-zi Ditch (the present-day Xining North Road) bears testimony to the heyday of Dadaocheng in the first half of the 20th century.</xbody><avBegin>2011/10/25</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/11</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Datong Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 73, Gui’de Street</address><xpostDate>2015/03/11</xpostDate><file><img description="Chen Tian-Lai's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000899.jpg</img><img description="Chen Tian-Lai's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000900.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>By MRT: Get off at MRT Shuanglian Station and walk for 15 minutes from Exit 2 1.By bus: Take Red 33 and get off at Dadaocheng Wharf; or, take 255, 518, 539, or 669 and get off at Minsheng West Road stop. 2.By car: parking is available outside the 3rd and 5th Water Gates</info><longitude>121.508405</longitude><latitude>25.056090</latitude><MRT>Shuanglian</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>140</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Art and Culture Centers</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2012022400000002</SERIAL_NO><stitle>The Kishu An Forest of Literature</stitle><xbody>The “New Building of Kishu An” on Tongan Street was launched by Taipei City’s Department of Cultural Affairs in an unprecedented attempt to dedicate a facility to literature. Operated by the Taiwan Association for Literature Development in June 2011, and officially known as “the Kishu An Forest of Literature”, the building incorporates scenic views of the Southside Literary Park into services both in- and outdoors, providing literature lovers a comfortable space to luxuriate in reading, writing, coffee, and surprising encounters with celebrated literary figures.  Soon to be restored, the historic Kishu An used to be a restaurant under Japanese colonial rule before being converted into personnel’s dormitory of the Chinese Nationalist government. It is the geographical center of an area in southern Taipei that features culturally significant streets and places in the history of Taiwan’s post-war literature, which include Kuling Street and two national universities. The area is the cradle of literary magazines/societies and prestigious publishers such as the Blue Star Club, the Chinese Literature and Arts Association, and Pure Literature Co. As the center of a literary Mecca where Lin Hai-yin and Lin Liang strived toward realizing their visions, alongside other prominent writers, Kishu An will be revamped as a historic symbol of Taiwanese literature.</xbody><avBegin>2012/02/24</avBegin><avEnd>2012/02/24</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongzheng Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 107, Tongan St.</address><xpostDate>2012/02/24</xpostDate><file><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D551/E136/F111/764eb8c3-2772-400b-b704-97a927085c33.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D937/E934/F290/68eda001-06dd-4b1d-90c6-279bd0448564.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D197/E102/F680/b37e730b-d0e4-4df8-8b41-0124c189c605.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D841/E107/F961/23822f25-ae37-4892-b370-c76dd0d66dbb.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D620/E575/F234/3cefdf81-2a29-4d3d-9e8f-e0dca7bcbaf3.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D4/E343/F868/52d452aa-d80b-457e-a395-f145d342381d.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D25/E256/F825/60c62fa9-552e-4e79-8313-a64e9a7dcb2a.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D7/E745/F162/1c98282f-511b-468d-a6c9-7bd02ba32d56.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E662/F133/12847810-0ac2-47c3-9195-c37854976c57.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D15/E638/F620/77735a70-8da7-437e-9242-0514a910ee59.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D15/E182/F393/b7db8ffc-6e4b-45cf-b90a-4ae3a49a0acd.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D14/E191/F872/8306668b-c2bb-4158-9ccf-7f11f7c8be59.jpg</img><img description="The Kishu An Forest of Literature">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E573/F521/afa1291c-0959-4ff8-8fe6-29798cd28d2f.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>From MRT Guting Station (behind Exit 2): approx. 10 min. on foot along Tongan St. to the end of the street (on the left) Buses No. 253, 297, 673: alight at the Qiang Shu High School stop, walk 5 min. along Tongan St. toward Riverside Park.

This sumptuously decorated, two-story Chinoiserie structure was completed in 1971 to mark the 60th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. Located at the geological center of Yangmingshan National Park, this building offers a spectacular view of the Taipei Basin in the distance. A pond in front of the building, observable from the second-floor veranda, is children’s favorite as they are allowed to feed the varicolored carp in it. Adding quaint and solemnly elegant appeal to Gaungfu Building are exquisite carvings, paintings and numerous other typical Chinese architectural details that subtly made references to literature classics.  When the flowers are in full bloom, the building becomes an island in a sea of cherry blossom petals.

The institute plans to give designers access to a database of designers/apparel manufacturers and incubator-oriented training programs, among other resources and assistance, in order to encourage collaboration between fashion designers and companies. It also serves as a liaison between fast pattern-making centers and designers, so the latter may focus on cultivating their expertise as creative designers and front-end workers in the fashion industry. A tree-inspired interior designA cradle of competent Taiwanese fashion designersThe Fashion Institute of Taipei, located in the culturally significant Bangka area (a.k.a. “Monga”) and previously known as the Taipei Costume Cultural Center, is a 3-story emerging fashion landmark with the Bangka (or Dali) Fashion District being its hinterland. Driven by the vision of “a tree of creativity”, the institute matches its brick-red exterior with an interior designed to resemble a tree nourished by Wanhua’s historical and cultural influences, which would hopefully foster local designers who give back to Bangka’s clothing business in the manner of decomposed foliage sustaining the soil. The institute vows to help its resident designers secure demonstration contracts with apparel firms from across the Bangka Shopping District, and eventually build worldwide reputation for the country’s original fashion brands and design prowess. Collaborating with academic institutes to nurture emerging designers is also a priority for the Fashion Institute of Taipei. In addition to guided tours for faculty members and students in areas pertaining to fashion or apparel, the institute launches summer internship programs to give students a sense of how a design project is linked to marketing efforts, other than acquiring an insight into the country’s ready-to-wear sector, through active involvement in Bangka’s clothing business operations and designer-corporate partnerships. Also available for local talent are analytical programs about the latest clothing trends, or professional fashion shows. An inspiration-packed facilityA resident designer program for maximum creativityDecorated with a color scheme centered on pure white, the ground-floor lobby is a space that offers fashion information while catering to all five senses, as evident in a catwalk stage for designers’ lovely projects and a café in the cozy corner, where visitors seek inspiration while sipping coffee and browsing through stylish clothes or glossy design-related publications. For greater efficiency, exciting films are played on interactive LCD screens (controlled using a device similar to Wii) on the ground floor to offer details about the Fashion Institute of Taipei, the cultural and historical aspect of Bangka, or the resident designers, including their styles and portfolios. The second floor is converted into a mobile work platform for designers, with personal studios closed to the public on weekdays. To encourage designers to push the envelope and present art museum-worthy clothes, this creativity-charged space comprises a pattern-making section where all fabrics are available for free. The institute is seeking additions to its list of the current five resident designers (Norah Hsu, Wei-xiang Zeng, Andre Kao, Xue-Zheng Lu and Yu-Lin Shih) through annual auditions aimed at scouting out fresh designers with the potential of shining in the international fashion industry. On the 3rd floor, an area suitable for moderate-scale fashion shows, exhibitions, performances and lectures, is thickly carpeted and upholstered for soundproofing. For further diversified and flexible use of rooms, the ceiling rails, arranged to resemble the map of Bangka, are combined with movable partitions to offer designers just the right amount of space. The exhibition and performance facility, complete with backstage dressing rooms for models, are available for rent by fashion design majors for training courses or fashion shows. </xbody><avBegin>2012/06/20</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 9, Sec. 2, Xiyuan Rd.</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="The Fashion Institute of Taipei">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D33/E407/F220/6601a3e4-4e3f-4526-9daa-17091e75a1f5.jpg</img><img description="Fashion Institute of Taipei (Taipei Costume Cultural Center)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D25/E764/F910/d7b4768b-425e-4daf-a8a8-07b9ad328001.jpg</img><img description="Fashion Institute of Taipei (Taipei Costume Cultural Center)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D4/E342/F532/f63d1e8d-afb5-49d0-9142-79c0bab4f2f8.jpg</img><img description="Fashion Institute of Taipei (Taipei Costume Cultural Center)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D24/E457/F566/4d6f356f-da34-4b92-ba1b-a451d0045e0d.jpg</img><img description="Fashion Institute of Taipei (Taipei Costume Cultural Center)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D29/E894/F505/6cdeac01-f65e-4fad-b8a6-331d2cac4c60.jpg</img><img description="Fashion Institute of Taipei (Taipei Costume Cultural Center)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D3/E389/F98/3a68d628-5518-4b0a-a68d-bdd18d34aa54.jpg</img><img description="Fashion Institute of Taipei (Taipei Costume Cultural Center)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D18/E255/F656/3963a2f7-b03e-489a-9ee3-04edfad7c281.jpg</img><img description="Fashion Institute of Taipei (Taipei Costume Cultural Center)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D5/E366/F506/48b2caf8-4911-4943-bf41-52caf7a411ca.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Approx. 5 min. walk from MRT Longshan Temple Station (Exit 2).Bus: 38 (shuttle), 234, 265 (incl. shuttle), 651, 673, 705, Blue 28: alight at the Taipei Costume Cultural Center</info><longitude>121.498205</longitude><latitude>25.032339</latitude><MRT>Longshan Temple </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>143</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Blue Highway</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2011111200000001</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Meiti Wharf</stitle><xbody>Located outside the No. 16 Water Gate of Keelung River in front of Meiti Evacuation Gate, Meiti Pier is a port in the “Blue Highway” waterway network, similar in layout to Dajia Pier.

It was the only residence Chiang chose to build in Taiwan and became one of the culturally and historically significant buildings in the Yangmingshan National Park. Offering services ranging from travel information to guided tours, this recreational spot integrates nature and culture; sense and sensibility. The history of the Yangmingshuwu can be divided into the “forest park” period, the “Zhongxing Guesthouse” period, the “Historical Commission of Kuomintang (KMT) Central Committee” period and the “national-park administration” period. The approximately 15-hectare site is located on Zhongxing Road, adjacent to the Flower Clock near Yangjin Highway and Dongsheng Road. Nestled in what was initially a primitive forest, the Yangmingshuwu is overseen by the Yangmingshan Administration; it once served as a campsite of the General Association of the Scouts of China. The Zhongxing Guesthouse and its appendix buildings were completed in 1970, with the forest remaining partially intact. After Chiang Kai-shek moved into the guesthouse, the neighboring area was heavily guarded for security reasons, hence the diversified eco-system in the academy’s proximity and along Zhongxing Road. In 1975, the Zhongxing Guesthouse was renamed as Yangmingshuwu (shuwu literally means “document house”) as it became the location of the Historical Commission of KMT Central Committee’s office, as well as the collective storage place for historical documents previously kept in Caotun and Qingtan, and also for historical materials relating to Chiang Kai-shek from the Daxi Information Office and the Zhishanshuwu. On Sep. 26, 1997, the Historical Commission of KMT Central Committee donated the aboveground structure and the administrative rights of Yangmingshuwu to the Ministry of the Interior, which in turn placed the Yangmingshan National Park in charge of the operations. With careful planning, the Yangmingshuwu was reopened to the public on Jun. 27, 1998, after the establishment of an administrative office. The Da-yi Hall was built to expand tourist services, followed by the Yangmingshuwu Visitor Center beginning to offer tourist information, videos, back-lit panels, scale model exhibits and guided tours on Sep. 11, 2000. </xbody><avBegin>2012/09/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Beitou Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 12, Zhongxing Rd., Yangmingshan</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Yangmingshuwu">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F436/da3b3dea-4f00-4100-b2ee-a885c1bbff50.JPG</img><img description="Yangmingshuwu">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F437/7b0f3ab9-6d75-4af9-a034-202f40098f9c.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Start at the Taipei Main Station: Take the MRT Danshui or Beitou Line to the MRT Jiantan Station  Bus Red No. 5  Yangmingshan Main Station Transfer to Bus 108 (Leisure) Start at Taipei Fine Arts Museum: 1.

During World War II, the hotel was converted into a reception hall for Japanese Kamikaze pilots before their suicide operations. In the 1960s, after Taiwan was returned to the rule of the nationalist government, General Zhang Xueliang was placed under house arrest along with his wife at the site by then-president Chiang Kai-shek for organizing the Xi’an Incident, in which Zhang emphasized his belief that fighting against the Japanese invasion should be a top priority. The location of the house arrest was renovated in 1984 into a Zen Garden to preserve Beitou’s historic details that prevailed in architecture over the last few centuries, and then converted into what is now the martial-themed Marshal Zen Garden. Due to its relatively higher altitude, the restaurant overlooks the entire Beitou hot-spring zone and Guanyinshan. When the weather permits, patrons can see the landscape against the dazzling backdrop of sunset, and enjoy delicacies from a classic menu made famous by Mr. and Mrs. Zhang, while at the same time, the site boasts an endless supply of white sulphur spring, a local specialty, in private bathrooms; it is an awesome destination for ecological, historical, sightseeing or culinary tours.</xbody><avBegin>2013/05/15</avBegin><avEnd>2013/05/15</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Beitou Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 34, Yuya Rd.</address><xpostDate>2013/05/15</xpostDate><file><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D4/E998/F699/b33a0d96-a35b-444f-9ead-f72d5efaa65d.jpg</img><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F470/887da79a-7790-423c-84e3-2c35e5784256.jpg</img><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F471/ebc1ef23-ebdf-46f5-a315-fe5ec6c0d3a8.jpg</img><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F472/fff8b9c4-c05d-4301-ad05-f06b3854d119.jpg</img><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F473/b69a52e7-2789-4d48-ba70-c1b3b5c600e8.jpg</img><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F474/ee03ce07-ba61-44b5-a4ba-7097dd85948c.JPG</img><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D11/E533/F673/5b5e3ac5-a1dc-4c1d-9aa0-66ec25209e9c.JPG</img><img description="Marshal Zen Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D23/E513/F148/bd1fc22f-ed0f-4cb5-a0a3-850f9d82e2de.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>1.From MRT Beitou Station, take Bus No. 230 or S25, and alight at Taiwan Folk Arts Museum(Beitou Museum)2.Shuttle service is available from MRT Beitou Station; call (02) 2893-5336 for reservations</info><longitude>121.513748</longitude><latitude>25.138573</latitude><MRT>Beitou  </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>153</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Art and Culture Centers</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2013070200000004</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TIME>All venues open 24 hours a day; Ice Land: 9AM-9PM every day</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Taipei Arena</stitle><xbody>The Taipei Arena, situated at the intersection of Dunhua N.

The entire valley maintains almost the same ecological landscape that existed more than a hundred years ago. There are abundant plants in the park, with insects calling and birds singing, where natural resources such as low-elevation forests and streams are also preserved. The rare ecological park in the City is divided into several areas: Natural Succession Area, Butterfly Watching Area, Formosan Giant Flying Squirrel Observation Area and Taipei Tree Frog Observation Area. Other than tree frogs, butterflies and Formosan Giant Flying Squirrels, the Park has a total of 5000 trees covering 331 plant species, such as: Incense machilus (Machilus zuihensis), Formosa acacia (Acacia confusa), Turn In The Wind (Mallotus paniculatus), Elephant’s Ear (Macaranga tanarius), etc. In the surroundings, there are houses of the military dependents’ village, preserved forts, culverts and vicissitudinous stone steps.

Standing on the bustling plaza, the bell rang every hour in prayer, tolling for peace and safety, as well as for protection from any such natural disaster. Designed to resemble two palms closed together, facing each other in prayer, the bell features 108 nipple-like bits, made from yellow-hued glass; the gentle flowing water form a little fountain at the bottom. The joined hands suggest well-wishing and also toleration; it teaches people to tolerate disaster-induced changes while healing the wounds they inflict. Meanwhile, water streaming quietly downward from the bell symbolizes everlasting human vitality. Gentle as it may be, the sound of bell brings peace of mind. The Bell of Peace and Safety is a joint project by architect Kris Yao and glass artist Heinrich Wang. Measuring at 6 meters in length and 5 meters in width, this cast bronze project was funded entirely by the Dharma Drum Mountain Humanities and Social Improvement Foundation.

Yangmingshan in the back, Songshan to the east and Tamsui to the west. With its signature red columns and golden roof, the hotel’s magnificent exterior presents a sumptuously classic ambiance that reflects the beauty of traditional Chinese arts. The hotel is one of Taipei City’s world-renowned landmarks, and also the premium choice for travel accommodation or business conferences for people worldwide. The beauty of the Grand Hotel comes from its stately Chinese-style structures and splendid classic setting; the mystique of the hotel lies in its legendary, historic significance and the rumor about a secret underground passageway; one can chalk the hotel’s otherworldly serenity to its great location, adjacent to a scenic belt away from the urban bustle.The century-old golden dragons The bronze dragons were initially desgined statues guarding the entrance to Taiwan Jinjia (built in 1901 in the style of a Japanese Shinto shrine). They were carefully preserved during re-constructions of the Grand Hotel, to be later perfectly displayed in the hotel’s Gold Dragon Restaurant; the dragons were accentuated with 24-karat gold plating as part of the hotel’s renovation efforts in 1987. It is worth noting that these dragons have three claws only, compared to the four or five claws on dragons depicted in traditional Chinese paintings. Plum-flower caisson ceiling On the center of the hotel lobby’s ceiling is a plum blossom-shaped caisson, with five golden dragons encircling a pearl, suggesting the “Five Blessings.” Inspired by the Chinese pronunciation of “3” sounding like “rise” and the number 16 plus the large plum blossom, the 23 golden dragons and 16 phoenixes in the caisson were deliberately designed to signify rising to prominence and continuous profits, respectively. The caisson ceiling is also a profound traditional symbol of prosperity, represented by the dragons and phoenixes. Upturned eaves and bucket arch On the rooftop, both the upturned eaves and bucket arch embody ancient Chinese culture. While a row of animals crouch above the vertical ridge of the dramatically upturned eaves, the Chiwei, or monster-like ornaments made from roofing shingles, are poised between the main ridge and vertical ridge. The sumptuously delicate yet robust bucket arch structure under the roof is one of the greatest wonders in Chinese architecture. Glass doors of the hotel lobby The gigantic, yet gracefully symmetrical, floor-to-ceiling glass doors of the lobby serve as the front entrance of The Grand Hotel. Look closely, and you will see six ancient Chinese characters signifying “Long Live the Republic of China”, hidden under the decorative patterns. The creativity of the design and how times have changed are surely impressive, considering the historical background of the hotel. Stone tablet Erected at the beginning of a stone staircase leading to the arched entrance is a giant stone tablet inscribed with the cursive-style characters “Jian-Tan-Sheng-Ji”. After verification from various sources, the words depicted in the free-flowing and powerful calligraphic work of the late politician Yu You-ren, are believed to mean that the Yuanshan area is sanctified, which offers an explanation for the Grand Hotel remaining popular and revered over the past century.</xbody><avBegin>2012/09/14</avBegin><avEnd>2013/08/28</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongshan Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 1, Sec. 4, Zhongshan N.

Built with elaborately crafted stones from the suburban Dazhi area, the South Gate features a hornless dragon (chilong) motif that sets it apart from similar structures in the neighborhood. Having survived the Japanese colonialist offensives that ruined much of the city’s protective structures, though, the South Gate, nevertheless, was starting to show signs of age. A Nationalist Government’s attempt to restore its façade in the Northern Chinese palatial style totally changed its looks but, fortunately, preserved both the masonry foundation and round opening in the wall. Located beside the Class-1 historic site of Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau at the intersection of Gongyuan Rd., Nanchang St and Aiguo W. Rd., and due to its proximity to the President’s Residence, the area is heavily guarded with “plainclothes” military policemen who can easily intimidate passersby, which is a shame.

It resembles the shape of a fish enveloped in river- or sea-water and adorned with layers of wave-like stripes, creating an incredible illusion of motion as if it were swimming ahead with ease. Some gaps in the marble create a space where the tangible mixes with the intangible, to offer a thought-provoking metaphor for the relationship between fish and water. Lin Chin-Tsung , who created “Peaceful and Content”, is a Hualien resident with inexhaustible passion for the art of stone carving. He is impressed by how the naturally occurring Hualien marble comes in varying hues with natural bands of colors, and how water erosion gives it widely distinctive shapes ranging from clouds in the sky to adorable animals on land. As a result, he started using marble to create artworks that are one of a kind. His renowned projects include: “A Fish-Shaped Landscape”, which was erected in front of the Hualien County Government building, “Fish” in the Xiao Yehliu National Scenic Area, Taitung, and “Peaceful and Content” at the intersection of Dunhua-Nanjing Roads.</xbody><avBegin>2011/11/12</avBegin><avEnd>2014/11/17</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Songshan Dist.,Taipei CityDunhua North Rd.</address><xpostDate>2014/11/17</xpostDate><file><img description="Peaceful and Content (Ru-Yu-De-Shui)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000966.jpg</img><img description="Peaceful and Content (Ru-Yu-De-Shui)">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11000967.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>By MRT: Songshan-Xindian Line-Taipei arena Station By Bus: Take Bus No. 266, 266 (shuttle), 279, 282, 282 (sub-line), 288, 306, 306 (shuttle) or 307(South Songshan Line) and alight at Nanjing-Dunhua Intersection; or take Bus No. 0 East, 262, 262 (shuttle), 275, 275 (sub-line), 275 (shuttle), 277, 285, 33, or 521 and alight at Taipei Student Hostel.</info><longitude>121.548647</longitude><latitude>25.051838</latitude><MRT>Nanjing Fuxing</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>161</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Other</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2013051500000016</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>+886-2-2314-8080</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_TIME>Mon. to Sat. 10 AM-6 PM

It is a two-story hybrid building of stone and wood. The overall decoration lacks complexity, yet fineness can be found in its simple, understated beauty. The architectural design of the building was deeply influenced by the classical European style. The first floor of the structure was built using heavy piling of stone materials laid to form an elegant arcade of four columns and three spaces, where the arches are composed of trapezoid Qili’an rocks. Patterns pieced together by wood can be found in the arcade ceiling. The second floor and roof trusses are all made of wood, covered with pieces of asbestos tiles on the mansard roof. The outward appearance features steep roof and dormers on the façade, as well as stone arcade columns.

It is the core of Taiwan’s modern medical development. Currently, the buildings on the west site are used for outpatient services and wards. The Renaissance-style double storey red brick reinforced concrete building was designed by Mr. Juro Kondoh. The floor plan adopts a symmetrical pattern, with the central passage passing through the entire building, connecting the various clinics and wards. The grand and spacious main lobby features various western architecture techniques. It is considered a masterpiece of modern western architecture.

It used to be the Koo’s riverside residence in Dadaocheng and received its name from the salt business that the family was running. Designed to situated face the Tamsui Wharf, the house allowed shipping boats to be moored right in front of it. Two years after the Koos moved out of the house in 1961, the Rongxing Kindergarten was opened on the site. Unique even by today’s standards, this late-Renaissance structure shows signs of Western influence on the luxury estates at the time, such as the arched hallway, the façade that featured the pale yellow tiles, and the gracefully arched windows. Inside the house, the frequent use of Chinese cypress in well preserved ceiling and stairs, along with a wall marked with the logo of Koo Hsien-jung’s Dahe Trading Company.

The century-old main structure was unveiled later in 1913 and is largely still preserved today, thanks to frequent restoration efforts. Initially used to house classrooms and an administrative center, the main structure grew into a national hub of medical research, a fortress of medical education reform, a site of medical humanities education and, in 2008, a museum. In addition to permanent exhibits such as “A New Born”, “The Peopling of Taiwan” and “Taiwanese People’s Struggle against Diseases”, the Museum offers special exhibits every six months to explore the impact of medical studies. It also displays exhibit items at medical education institutions nationwide. In the style of the later French Renaissance, the stately museum features graceful curves and carvings in the lobby, on the main wall and columns, with arched designs sumptuously used in the lobby and hallways for extra elegance.

In recent years, many artists and creative studios have moved into the Village and opened themselves to the public through the policy of revitalization and conservation, forming unique scenery where cultural coexistence clusters are scattered along the hillside. In addition, a two- or three-hundred-year-old Buddhist temple worshipping Guanyin stands on the hillside; it is a place for people to worship or pray for blessings.

The City’s Geotechnical Engineering Office spent a hefty sum on a renovation effort that added hiking trails, observation decks and industrial roads to the park project, which connects the Neishuangxi mountain areas in Neihu and Shilin Districts. The effort resulted in the integration of Neishuangxi woodlands, the forest park, the Bishan Campsite, the Baishihu Agricultural Community, and many other scenic and ecological resources to set local tourism in motion. At the entrance to the forest park, the Bixi Bridge is flanked by Formosan Tree Frogs carved out of stone to underscore the ecological diversity in “Little Xitou.” From the semicircular view deck built along bridge guardrails, visitors are treated to a visual feast of streams murmuring against a backdrop of peculiarly shaped rocks on Mt. Shitou. On the hiking trail, a 6-meter-tall, spectacular viewing platform made of 100% black sandalwood is propped up by four log columns and overlooks Dalunwei and Yuanshanzi Mountains; it is complete with a plum blossom-shaped public square at the entrance for hikers to catch their breath and take a short break. User-friendly, interactive sessions are also available at the park’s demonstration solar cell-powered system to promote energy conservation. The Neishuangxi Forest Park’s ecological diversity is attributable to the plentiful water resources in Bixi Catchment Area, a location where species native to the ancient Xueshan Mountain Range and the emerging Datun Mountain Range meet and highlighting the scenic beauty of various landforms. That is why the park is able to provide recreation based on a pleasant, relaxed and environmentalist lifestyle.</xbody><avBegin>2012/06/20</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.shiaushitou.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=1228368&amp;CtNode=36898&amp;mp=10500C</xurl><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei CityLane 150, Sec. 3, Zhishan Rd.</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Entrance to Bixi Bridge">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D4/E929/F6/e1f4ba7a-6eec-4081-9403-527a531553f0.jpg</img><img description="Natural forest trail system">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F369/95f96e4a-9ee9-406f-a499-7ea8e055188f.jpg</img><img description="The Healing Garden">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F370/8251ec0d-6ceb-4bd2-8d30-1c605698b521.jpg</img><img description="Neishuangxi Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F513/28503368-f221-4957-bee7-0290252e1bbd.jpg</img><img description="Neishuangxi Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F514/257b7960-0a9c-4598-995d-a93903899e69.jpg</img><img description="Neishuangxi Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F515/a89f5068-a0c4-4f84-b669-bf707e5c6169.jpg</img><img description="Neishuangxi Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F516/7a70ab14-81ec-4b5a-8d4b-eda4267a68ee.jpg</img><img description="Neishuangxi Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F517/29e9cfc8-58d2-4242-a740-b2de0780cab3.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>From MRT Jiantan Station, take Mini Bus No. 1 to Xishan Horticultural Nursery, or take Mini Bus No. 18 to Bixi Bridge, and then walk toward Xishan Horticultural Nursery.</info><longitude>121.577094</longitude><latitude>25.115364</latitude><MRT>Jiantan </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>167</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Other</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2013101400000002</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Observation Deck in the Beitou Refuse Incineration Plant</stitle><xbody>Beitou Refuse Incineration Plant was inaugurated on Jul. 1, 1991 as “Shilin Refuse Incineration Plant”.

It is well-preserved and still in use. This trail is not only a shortcut to Shanzhuku and Tukuqiu, but it also leads to some ancient relics. Today, the trail is paved with granite, and despite its renovation, it still has a touch of archaic ambiance.Starting point of Gengliao Historic TrailThe ancient “Pan’s Family House” is the only house in Nangang that still possesses bullet holes from war, and is still inhabited. Eight generations of the Pan family have lived here, meaning that the house is at least 160 years old, as old as the trail!On the way to Laoliao Historic Trail, the Shihui Mine Tunnel is a remnant of our forefathers’ exploration. The remnant of Wei Jingshi Residence recalls the origin of the once prosperous tea industry here, despite the current sadness reflected by its remaining walls. Other places such as Tujiao House, Zheng’s family graveyard and the mere 30cm tall Land Deity Temple are all evidence of the ancient history of this trail.Rediscovering the Home of TeaThe history of tea development can be traced back two hundred years. During the rule of Emperor Qianlong, this place was an important production center of camphor and tea. Wang Shuijing and Wei Jingshi researched and developed the Wenshan-style Paochong tea and Nangang-style Paochong tea, respectively. Together, they ushered in the golden era of Nangang tea, and its fame spread far and wide.Laoliao Historic Trail was a tea road that tea merchants and villagers took 110 years ago.The name “Laoliao” was derived later based on the homonymy of the sounds. Gengliao Historic Rail, on the other hand, was used by night watchers (gengfu) in the Qing Dynasty on patrol, and during the Japanese occupation era, the trail served as a transport channel for tea between Shengkeng and Nangang. </xbody><avBegin>2011/11/13</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.geo.gov.taipei/ct.asp?xItem=37483063&amp;ctNode=67811&amp;mp=106051</xurl><address>Nangang Dist.,Taipei CitySection 2, Jiuzhuang St.</address><xpostDate>2015/03/23</xpostDate><file><img description="Nangang Mountain System: Old Genliao Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002065.jpg</img><img description="Nangang Mountain System: Old Genliao Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002066.jpg</img><img description="Nangang Mountain System: Old Genliao Hiking Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11002067.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Station: Alight at Kunyang Station and take Bus S5 to Jiuzhuang Second Stop.By Bus: 212, 276, 306, 645.

Born in Tainan City in 1921, she learned the basics of dancing from Ishii Baku, the Japanese “father of modern dance”, before committing herself to introducing modern dance into Taiwan. She was revered as “ the mother of Taiwanese modern dance” because of her 500-odd productions that cover genres ranging from ballet to folk dances of all ethnicities; the productions she helped inspired include: “The Song of India” and “We Love Our Taiwan”. The historic structure of Tsai Jui-yueh Dance Research Institute was one of the tens of dormitories for Japanese colonial officials built around 1925 on Zhongshan N. Rd. and downtown Taipei; they were mostly wooden, Japanese-style duplexes. In 1953, Tsai purchased this former residence of a Japanese “Haninkan” official, with part of the house designated for choreographic rehearsals. She went on to convert it into a dance studio. In 1999, scholars insisted that Tsai’s dance studio, once destroyed in a fire and coveted by real estate developers, should be restored as a historic site in homage to Taiwanese modern dance.</xbody><avBegin>2012/01/09</avBegin><avEnd>2013/04/25</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongshan Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 10, Lane 48, Section 2, Zhongshan N.

The park is divided into a Core Zone, a Buffer Zone and a Sustainable Utilization Zone, according to the type of ecological resources, in an effort to preserve and protect the natural environment with the fauna/flora habitats intact. Inaccessible to the general public, the Core Zone is a major wetland restoration site largely dedicated to the restoration and maintenance of bird habitats. The educationally-functional Buffer Zone separates the Sustainable Utilization Zone and Core Zone with hedgerows or blockade ditches; it consists of freshwater ponds, tidal ponds, aquatic plants and marsh plants, each representing a distinctive eco-system. Growing among the artificially planned and cultivated park turfs are many herbaceous and woody plants that insects feed on, while the sizeable population of invertebrates on mudflats and shoals offer perfect food for Scolopacidae and Charadriidae. Primarily designed for family recreation and bird watchers, the Sustainable Utilization Zone is installed with a duck-watching trail, a bird observatory square and a family-friendly zone, where people can enjoy outdoor activities with relatively little environmental impact. To further promote ecological education, large-scale duck- and goose-watching events are hosted in the park during the migratory-bird season, with guided tours available on weekends/holidays. The Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park, which lies beyond the embankment, and Huazhong Riverside Park, are perfect for wild bird watching; their comprehensive facilities ensure easy observation of the fascinating eco-systems.</xbody><avBegin>2013/07/29</avBegin><avEnd>2013/08/08</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityLocated west of Huajiang Bridge</address><xpostDate>2013/08/08</xpostDate><file><img description="Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D17/E414/F406/5071baaa-e80f-4ac3-919c-e0fa5b545146.JPG</img><img description="Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D21/E53/F867/55f87267-22f0-40a3-bb9b-8d70bb5c9493.jpg</img><img description="Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D23/E594/F813/93dd4412-eec7-4e7b-b13d-fe3133d07f79.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.493488</longitude><latitude>25.038135</latitude><MRT>Longshan Temple </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>174</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Art and Culture Centers</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2013051500000009</SERIAL_NO><stitle>The Mountain Theater of U Theatre</stitle><xbody>The Mountain Theater of U Theatre occupies an area of more than 1,000 pings (approx. 3,300 m2) in the Laoquan Village on Mt.

This facility is expected to enable the U Theatre performers to merge drumming, meditation and Chinese martial arts in a serene setting, away from the downtown bustle. It is worth noting that the performers built their own rehearsal area by laying down the wooden structures and crossties. The Mountain Theater consists of two parts: a wooden house for the performers’ meditation sessions and drumming practices that is off-limits to visitors without reservations, and an open stage for commercial performances and rehearsals, which is open to the public.

The refinery was then used by Taiwan Sugar Corporation (Taisugar) for warehousing, with small-and-mid factories such as chemical engineering plants and food processors thriving on the idle sugar-making space. Following the cluster of printing houses formed in the 1950s around the present-day headquarters of China Times, which took over the Taisugar warehouses, the expanded rail transport services sent clothing wholesalers mushrooming in the 1970s and 1980s. Dali Street had been a production center in Taipei until the urban planning authorities shifted their focus to the City’s east end amid the changing industrial pattern. The once prosperous “Huei-xia-vei” neighborhood and industrial landscape at the rear of the refinery were marginalized due to a deteriorating quality of life, a high density of population and buildings, and the lack of public amenities. In a protest against a nursery project, the Dali Street residents were granted a park project to preserve Taiwan’s farthest north-lying sugar-making facility, the main structure of which is a warehouse featuring red-brick masonry, arched gates, trapezoidal columns and a large-span framework.

It is a flat, saddle-shaped area encircled by Mt. Zhuzi, Mt. Qigu, Mt. Ding and Mt. Huangzui that used to be a terrace formed by lava from Mt. Zhugao. Qingtiangang was designated by Japanese colonial rulers as the site of the Dalingzhi Ranch for tea-growing and cattle-herding purposes. After taking over Taiwan, the Chinese nationalist government established the Yangmingshan Ranch in the Qingtiangang /Lengshuikeng area, following the original Japanese tradition. Once Taipei City was placed under the administration of the Executive Yuan, the Taipei City Farmers’ Association became responsible for the ranch operations, with the cattle herds on Qingtiangang being owned by farmers in Beitou, Shilin and Jinshan. With gently rolling meadows and dazzling verdancy, the evenly surfaced Qingtiangang is a wonderful outdoor classroom for grassland observation, and the most popular hiking destination in Yangmingshan National Park, with a foot path impressively lined with undulating grass and stumpy shrubs.</xbody><avBegin>2013/05/15</avBegin><avEnd>2013/05/15</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 246, Lane 101, Jingshan Rd.</address><xpostDate>2013/05/15</xpostDate><file><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D30/E379/F72/b92ec36f-b5ce-485f-bbbd-172e66b1ee41.jpg</img><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F464/e3f672d9-37cf-459f-830d-e8a7fe3880dd.JPG</img><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F465/d3c61e0b-0a6a-4a7d-8b50-283fece27937.JPG</img><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F466/76b58f97-6ee3-45e7-9f4f-82addf7720f2.JPG</img><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F467/9580709c-3aa4-4728-8db2-c4406abca772.JPG</img><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F468/3fdd52de-6579-4413-a9d6-67a76d80fca8.JPG</img><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F469/2b80d07c-b6fb-49d3-bada-e2973109b129.JPG</img><img description="Qingtiangang Grassland">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F611/1ff6c974-a658-48f9-8d61-95884c9d2cba.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Alight at MRT Shilin Station, and transfer to Bus S15 at Shilin District Office.Take S15 or Leisure Bus 108 (Yangmingshan National Park Shuttle Bus) to Qingtiangang.</info><longitude>121.574090</longitude><latitude>25.167169</latitude><MRT>Shilin  </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>181</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Public Art</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2012010900000006</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Jump</stitle><xbody>Standing conspicuously on the channelization island where Qingcheng Street and Dunhua N.

The Chen family’s ancestors came from Anxi County, Quanzhoufu of Fujian Province. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the early Chen members traveled to Taiwan as pioneers. It wasn’t until the early Guangxu era that they invested a huge sum of money to construct the Yifangju Estate. This traditional sanheyuan (a three-section compound) was typical of the ancient residences of the Taipei basin area. The main hall was constructed in a U-shape design; the walls of the main hall and ancillary halls (to the left and right of the main hall) were built with bricks, and few windows and doors were present. In addition, a firearms cabinet was built on the second floor of the ancillary halls to guard the residence against robbers. Furthermore, most of the window frames were made with rocks produced in Taipei. The door plate of the residence indicated that it was constructed around the 2nd year of Emperor Guangxu. Due to the rapid modernization of Taipei City, traditional residences like Yifangju Estate continue to dwindle in number. It is important that those that remain are preserved as testimony of Taipei’s development history. </xbody><avBegin>2012/01/09</avBegin><avEnd>2015/08/19</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Da'an Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 128, Lane 155, Sec. 3, Keelung Rd.</address><xpostDate>2015/08/19</xpostDate><file><img description="Yifangju Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D1/E658/F948/9cd8608a-1b8c-4c0c-8785-6ba5a68987d0.jpg</img><img description="Yifangju Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D9/E849/F207/518d865f-20e7-4867-91b5-dcaf78db862b.jpg</img><img description="Yifangju Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D16/E31/F661/7813971a-a430-4ae8-a45a-f8c4d97dcfd1.jpg</img><img description="Yifangju Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D20/E413/F999/6c52c9b2-cbcf-4d88-9ffe-a45abb226ae7.jpg</img><img description="Yifangju Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D2/E569/F361/632210e7-e11d-42d1-af3a-c187722bb86c.jpg</img><img description="Yifangju Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D3/E772/F281/aef97aac-9aa0-43f9-b13d-f499f370c90f.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Bus: Green 11, 295 – alight at Fanlan Rd.

Rd., Sanshui St. and Xiyuan Rd. Developed by the Taipei City Government, it is a distinctively art-themed “folklore park” teeming with culturally significant details. For example, a dragon-inspired sculpture in the Park’s east side is inspired by a Chinese Feng Shui rule for good luck, being an azure dragon appearing on the left-hand side when facing south, while a boat sculpture in the west side recount a bit of history of the early settlers in the neighborhood who used canoes as a common means of transportation, ferrying and trade. Adjacent to a pond named “Beauty’s Mirror” is a viewing platform defined by Feng Shui principles in accordance with the position of the Big Dipper constellation, where illuminated “dancing water” shows are staged on a daily basis. After sunset, the Temple Gateway Square, an extension of the Longshan Temple into the Park’s north side, sees over 2,000 stars simultaneously radiating lights of varying colors from an astrological chart that consists of both Chinese and Western zodiac signs. Meanwhile, the roof tile-like structure of reinforced glass and vitreous enamel panels transforms the Park’s inverted U-shaped art gallery into a passageway with recreation and exhibition facilities. As an important public project in the City Government’s campaign of “Rotating the Axis of Urban Development and Regenerating Taipei West”, Bangka Park, along with its neighboring Longshan Temple, will hopefully blossom into a vibrant international tourist hotspot of historical, cultural and religious importance that buttresses western Taipei’s growth and business potential, and ultimately regains the glory of this two-century-old neighborhood.</xbody><avBegin>2013/05/15</avBegin><avEnd>2014/09/02</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityOpposite Longshan Temple</address><xpostDate>2014/09/02</xpostDate><file><img description="Bangka Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D18/E397/F746/1391d5db-0146-4ba6-9d84-a20253a723a0.JPG</img><img description="Bangka Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F488/0ab94a3f-25ab-4104-bda7-96bca1f036c2.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRTTake MRT Bannan Line and alight at Longshan Temple StationTrainAlight at Wanhua Railway Station and walk northward for 8 minutes.Busa.

Apart from the collection of Taiwan puppetry, there are also puppet collections of different styles hailing from different countries. A total of over 5,000 pieces of puppetry treasures were collected by the museum, which is a four-story building covering an area of about 200 pings (approx. 660m2). The museum comprises carving workshops, DIY classrooms, puppetry special exhibition room, fine works collection space and the Nadou Theatre (performance hall), suitable for all types of professional performances. The museum not only schedules puppetry exhibitions from time to time but also offers courses on hand puppet carving and making, demonstration by puppetry masters, parent-child puppetry theatre, and the promotion of techniques on traditional puppet theatre, allowing the general public to further acquaint themselves with the culture of puppet theatre.</xbody><avBegin>2013/05/15</avBegin><avEnd>2015/03/23</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Datong Dist.,Taipei CityNo.79, Xining N.

Camphor trees and dragon junipers are planted between two sides of the boulevard and the school buildings. While walking along Royal Palm Boulevard with the green shade of both sides arching the sunrise, one experiences a feeling of heading on a broad and open road to a bright future. It is a very special sunrise attraction in the City. Near the College of Agriculture, there are many aquatic plants, vegetables, fruits and vanilla gardens. Some interesting observations of ecological restoration can also be made in the experimental farm. The alleys near the campus are surrounded by mainstream bookstores and smaller independent bookstores, as well as the coffee culture, transforming the NTU neighborhood with a strong cultural element.</xbody><avBegin>2013/05/15</avBegin><avEnd>2013/05/15</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Da'an Dist.,Taipei CityNo.1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd.</address><xpostDate>2013/05/15</xpostDate><file><img description="National Taiwan University">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D12/E313/F572/2f974aff-f143-42f2-9d90-193ae64dc70c.png</img><img description="National Taiwan University">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F671/e446690f-6b76-4917-af0a-6f8e6978b65b.png</img><img description="National Taiwan University">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F672/7110234a-2540-4b98-aa62-d245192dbdf6.png</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Public Transport: After arriving in Taipei, take an MRT train on the Tamsui Line bound for Xindian, alight at Gongguan Station, and take Exit 2 or Exit 3 to reach the Main Campus of National Taiwan University.</info><longitude>121.535281</longitude><latitude>25.017774</latitude><MRT>Gongguan </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>191</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2012062000000025</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TIME>Tue. - Sat., 10 AM-5PM; closed on Sundays and Mondays</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence</stitle><xbody>The Dr. Yin Hai-Kwong Residence was completed in 1945 in Alley 16, Lane 18, Wenzhou St., a neighborhood designated by Taihoku Imperial University (present-day National Taiwan University, or NTU) during the Japanese colonial. They were intended for professors’ dormitories, and nestled in a kind of lushness that was unique to academia. After relocating from mainland China in 1949, Dr. Yin Hai-Kwong taught philosophy at Taihoku Imperial University while contributing articles of political criticism to the Free China Journal. As a man who would rather die a critic than live muted, Dr. Yin was a warrior fighting with a pen despite the rigorous censorship. He stood up bravely against the then-authoritarian regime with unbridled political criticism, exerting a strong influence on Taiwan’s progress toward democracy, as an iconic figure in the history of Chinese liberalism. The residence is a one-story, Japanese-style wooden structure built on a triangular base, adjacent to the other dormitories. In May 2003, the Taipei City Government designated it as a historic site that housed a significant collection of cultural assets. The Dr. Yin Hai-Kwong Foundation in November 2008 took over the operation and maintenance of the residence, recently serving as a facility for NTU’s outdoor education activities.</xbody><avBegin>2012/06/20</avBegin><avEnd>2015/08/17</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Da'an Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 1-1, Alley 16, Lane 18, Wenzhou St.</address><xpostDate>2015/08/17</xpostDate><file><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D637/E262/F678/6590cbda-8851-4a7c-a928-f499796b7631.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D513/E518/F338/25e36073-86e1-4a65-85ee-5fc52a7fcbc7.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D38/E770/F706/94655ae1-1f2e-4fbc-a628-18dc056f5ad5.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D996/E305/F168/fbbdffd0-f20e-4838-aeb7-1f91365a05c0.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D257/E933/F917/09cff331-5832-4f73-a4d1-118de6daa51e.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D284/E348/F155/85bb6fde-b886-4d47-adc6-bbf7c162f3bc.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D164/E607/F700/dfd20e04-0cd4-4469-867e-c019fe45a46b.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D211/E709/F139/44579719-422a-4fc9-a637-42855b06e0fd.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D838/E618/F383/7e66ca61-467c-46e6-9fc1-3c5fef79e353.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D93/E819/F127/0fa29feb-0da4-4ba4-867f-f94a46ca6e42.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D560/E641/F674/e6b69bd5-96e2-4a3f-ba1a-62790db83db3.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D793/E393/F615/fc2846b3-05da-4edf-8fa4-f290dc430a07.jpg</img><img description="Yin Hai-Kuang's Residence">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D215/E775/F698/6093e731-663c-4f0b-9bf3-8edabee4041a.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>1.

This park is located by the Xindian riverbank and is a neighboring park to Qingnian Park. “Machangding Memorial Park” was formerly a plot of land used for military purposes, and the Taipei City Government, through negotiations with various parties, successfully won for the right to build the “Machangding Memorial Park”. Together with the nearby Huajiang Wild Duck Nature Park, they provide the Wanhua District a nice place for leisure and relaxation activities. The long stairway by the riverbank is a good place to watch the sunrise. With its wide horizon, one can see the beautiful reflection of the sun on the surface of the river. On a fine weather day, you will see the morning sun slowly rising from the side of the Taipei 101 skyscraper at a distance, with the morning rays occasionally seeping through the clouds and casting glorious reflections on the Xindian River, forming a river of gold, which is truly mesmerizing. A mound was erected in the Machangding Memorial Park, and the stele in front of the mound is inscribed with this message: “1950s marked a martial law period where hot-blooded men and righteous men who pursued social justice and political reform were arrested and executed near the Machangding mound. Machangding mound is preserved in memory of this historical event and the heroic death of the thousands who have sacrificed their lives for Taiwan. It is also a place for future generations to visit and pay their respect.”</xbody><avBegin>2011/11/12</avBegin><avEnd>2011/12/07</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityShuiyuan Road and Qingnian Road intersection</address><xpostDate>2011/12/07</xpostDate><file><img description="Machangding Memorial Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11003650.jpg</img><img description="Machangding Memorial Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11003651.JPG</img><img description="Machangding Memorial Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/pic/11003652.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Take Bus 204 and alight at Huazhong Riverside Park (I) or Bus 12, 532, 630, or Blue 29, and alight at Changtai Street Sto</info><longitude>121.504046</longitude><latitude>25.019365</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>199</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Other</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2013051500000005</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TEL>886-2-2546-8766</MEMO_TEL><MEMO_TIME>Open Tue.-Sat. 10 AM-5 PM.

Rd., the site of Nylon Cheng’s self-immolation in a free speech campaign, with a memorial sign bearing the name “Liberty Lane”, which was inaugurated by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin on August 21st of the same year. Mayor Hao friendliness and tolerance have always been Taipei City’s most valuable cultural assets, and the respect for different cultures, opinions and political ideologies not only lends a touch of gentleness and diversity to the City’s overall ambiance, it also constitutes a critical part of the philosophy underlying life in Taipei. This explains why Liberty Lane and Nylon Cheng Memorial Museum are significant in terms of tourism and culture, and also why they are a critical asset in Taiwan’s democratic education for the younger generation. Nylon Cheng Memorial Museum in Liberty Lane was built on the former office site of the now-discontinued Freedom Era Weekly. The entrance is decorated with a bronze statue and a huge portrait of Cheng. In the solemn space inside the building, there is a memorabilia display which contains Cheng’s personal items, manuscripts, memorabilia and photographs of his activism in democratic movements and old publications of Freedom Era Weekly. Currently receiving visitors on a reservation basis, the museum provides insights into the sacrifice and contributions made by this Taiwanese martyr of democracy and free speech through documentaries and guided tours. Visitors are expected to develop newfound respect for this martyred hero of democracy, and understand why the City government is making every effort to uphold free speech as a hard-earned, prized asset. </xbody><avBegin>2013/05/15</avBegin><avEnd>2015/08/17</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><xurl>http://www.nylon.org.tw</xurl><address>Songshan Dist.,Taipei CityAlley 3, Lane 106, Sec. 3, Minquan E.

In other words, the temple was constructed out of the founder’s ultimate compassion that urged her to extend self-help to others. Dedicated to “Wuji Yaochi Dasheng Xiwang Jinmu,” or “Mother of the Infinite Jade Pond,” this awe-inspiring, gracefully landscaped temple is nestled amid verdant hills to evoke religious sentiments. That explains why it is a mythical sanctuary for Taoist deities and immortals, a Mcca for Taoists seeking peace of mind, and an intriguing must-visit for tourists. Occupying an area of approximately 33,000 m2, the towering Cihui Temple comprises a group of elaborately structured, five-story buildings flanked by pagoda-style bell towers for an imposing and magnificent effect. The patio outside the temple’s 2nd floor main hall commands a panoramic view of downtown Taipei, which is exciting and unforgettable enough to make you want to linger longer. Patterned after traditional Chinese temples, the main structure is a quaint mixture of the distinctive palatial arts from the Ming and Qing dynasties and modern architectural techniques, ingeniously accentuating the mountain area’s luscious pine woods with its red bricks and yellow rooftops, in a dazzling manner, like a green cocktail garnished with a red cherry.</xbody><avBegin>2013/07/02</avBegin><avEnd>2014/08/21</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 33, Ln. 251, Fude St.</address><xpostDate>2014/08/21</xpostDate><file><img description="Songshan Cihui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D2/E969/F94/3b266c5f-f4a6-435f-93a7-ae83a6ac994a.jpg</img><img description="Songshan Cihui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D31/E182/F351/bc1187f0-7750-413d-b777-0463c06b961f.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT: Walk 20 minutes from Exit 2 of MRT Houshanpi Station (Bannan Line), or get off at MRT Yongchun Station on Bannan Line (Exit 3), change to Bus No. 263 and get off at Fude Elementary School.Bus: Take 257, 263, 286 (subline), Xinyi Main Line (including tentative route) or Blue 10 and get off at Fude Elementary School</info><longitude>121.587483</longitude><latitude>25.036519</latitude><MRT>Yongchun </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>203</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Outing Locations</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2013101400000001</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Nangang Park</stitle><xbody>Built in 1988 on a sloping terrain, the 15.6-hectare waterfront Nangang Park boasts intriguing Chinese-style architectural highlights.

The pond and garden still remain in the square inside the gate. The Administrative Building is of a splendid, ornate Baroque style. The façade of the architecture has classic Greek pillars and semi-arches, and roof is covered with Japanese black tiles. It is a building where Chinese and Western creativity and ingenuity mix, exhibiting a unique beauty. As for the interior, in the spacious auditorium with a wide-span, the rostrum and seats are mostly valuable originals. In addition, the plane of this historic site is in the form of a four-section compound, with a courtyard in the middle.

Surrounded by Guoxing Road on the east, Qingnian Road on the west, Shuiyuan Road on the south and Qingnian Road on the north, the Park covers an area of 24.44 hectares. It was originally a military training site during the Japanese Occupation and was later converted into an airport. As it is located in the south of the City and stands opposite to Songshan Airport at the north, it was thus known as the South Airport. In 1953, Taipei Country Club, together with the Ministry of National Defense, founded Taipei Golf Club at the site. On 1974’s Youth Day, the Executive Yuan ordered the Taipei City Government to take over the golf course, which then converted it into the Youth Park. In October of the same year, the management was officially passed over to the Taipei City Government, and the reconstruction was completed in September 1977, providing a recreational place for Taipei residents.  The Park is surrounded by flowers and trees; it has beautiful sceneries and comprehensive sports facilities. Chargeable sports facilities include: 1 golf course near Guoxing Road, 8 swimming pools near Shuiyuan Road, 6 tennis courts to the south of the Park, and a billiard hall within the swimming complex. Free sports and recreational facilities including: basketball courts, badminton courts, baseball court, skating rink, tennis practice walls and outdoor sports complex can be found in various parts of the Park. There are also social educational facilities like the plant nursery, reading room, audio-visual room, outdoor amphitheater and police post, to serve the residents and tourists. Besides the various infrastructures, the Park’s landscape planning, green facilities and plants are the main attractions in beautifying the Park. At the Park’s entrance, the radial-shaped flowerbeds are planted with beautiful, colorful flowers (such as: garden balsam, cockscomb, scarlet sage, Mexican heather, spider flower, golden dewdrop, etc.). At the back of the flowerbeds are shrubs and flowers, such as: azalea, Graber's Pyracantha, garden croton, Kusamaki, Ixora, etc. Visitors will feel like they are entering a flower show, and will be mesmerized by the magnificent colors. At the center of the Park is a vast lawn, and surrounding this manicured and green field are banyan trees that form a dense green tunnel. Overlooked from afar, it looks like a sea of greenery, as if one is having a forest bath when wandering within it, which refreshes one physically and mentally. The sides of the lawn are grown with needle-leaved trees (hoop pine), which attract many morning exercisers. At the back of the lawn is a waterway that connects to the zigzagged bridge at the eastern-north of the Park. The side of the waterway is planted with aquatic plants, and there are fountains everywhere, making it a pleasant scenic landscape. Towards the east of the baseball court are maple trees, and as these trees mature, they form a maple forest. When the maple leaves fall, it creates a beautiful autumn-winter scene. The Park area is also planted with azaleas, and when they blossom in spring, the bright colors make the Park even more glamorous. Bushes, shrubs and lawns, decorated with flowerbeds, garden chairs, pavilions, foot massage paths, sculptures, and flat, broad walk paths, make it is an excellent example of a large-scale comprehensive park. The Youth Park is spacious and has a large variety of facilities, providing the public with recreational, sports, social educational and rehabilitation facilities, enjoyed by young and old, the disabled and healthy people. To maintain the beauty of a park, besides cherishing its beautiful landscape, it requires the support and care of the public when enjoying the fruits of the construction work of the City Government. </xbody><avBegin>2014/06/13</avBegin><avEnd>2014/06/16</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 199, Shuiyuan Road</address><xpostDate>2014/06/16</xpostDate><file><img description="Youth Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D18/E737/F52/9a118882-630e-4c02-9aa7-635414780fa1.jpg</img><img description="Youth Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F979/0ff9ed01-ea72-42e0-95c2-804e40d06c45.jpg</img><img description="Youth Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F980/23b9ee2a-b2f7-42ca-ba93-2e2270d3fae6.jpg</img><img description="Youth Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D0/E197/F981/dabe38dc-b815-4bab-a933-c6b476bb3cb7.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D601/E468/F380/14abbdf4-6df0-4579-8cfb-f8c66ced18a8.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D891/E130/F549/61ebec01-013b-4f47-9cf6-371325965c27.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D641/E364/F50/5ce911da-b83d-4f11-b100-25d6a1416a05.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D86/E947/F970/f9e11d01-4ed6-4282-9138-eb18f656642e.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Buses (Qingnian Road Stop): 12, Blue 29, 205, 212 Express, 532, 630</info><longitude>121.506906</longitude><latitude>25.022041</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>206</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2012091300000010</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TIME>Mon-Fri.: 11:30AM-9PM; Sat-Sun: 9AM-9PM</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Ma Ting-Ying's Residence</stitle><xbody>Ma Ting-Ying Residence is also known as Qiantian Seven-Six, being located at No. 6, Lane 7, Qingtian Street, in a neighborhood known for Taipei City’s largest concentration of historic Japanese-style housing, or ying-zhai. This mostly Hinoki-wood house was built in 1931 as Professor Adachi Masashi’s residence. It is a cross between Japanese and European architecture, with the left half including the reception room, study and dining room, featuring European-style details such as bookcases, glass bay windows, an outdoor flower bed and a porch, while the bedrooms and children’s room in the right half are covered with traditional Japanese Tatami mats. The house was taken over in 1945 by Ma Ting-ying, a professor of geology from NTU who befriended Adachi, and it officially became a city-designated historic site in 2006. In 2011, several NTU alumni rented the house from its governing body, the NTU, and the site has since been open to the public free of charge for guided tours and popular science activities.

Liang moved into the house when he was appointed the Head of NTNU’s Department of English in 1952.

It was also the only one of Taipei’s five century-old citadel gateways that was demolished over time, in the early Japanese colonial period, to be precise. In an effort to reproduce the memories of the Baocheng Gate and mark the 130th Anniversary of Taipei City Walls, an installation project entitled “Impression of Ximen” was erected behind MRT Ximen Station (Exit 4) this year.By geometrically deconstructing and then reconstructing Baocheng Gate, the designer of “Impression of Ximen” combined multiple frameworks and materials of varying heights and colors to provide a fresh insight into this historically glamorous neighborhood, and eventually bridge the gap between old and new. This gateway-themed, visually intriguing project impresses people walking through or past it, not only with a unique 360-degree interplay of light and shadow, but also with fun-filled interactions achieved through an “out-of-the-box” design concept that makes art a part of everyday life. Besides the historic gateway-inspired terra cotta and gray color combination, “Impression of Ximen” features kiln-fired granite pavement that echoes the masonry wall’s grain pattern, an acrylic-encased lighting solution that lends a soft luster to the nightscape, and a shaded seating area for pedestrians. A vision of light right across from Exit 6 of the ever-crowded MRT Ximen Station, this see-through structure engages passersby in a dialogue that would hopefully bring prosperity to Ximending and Taipei’s west end alike.</xbody><avBegin>2014/12/15</avBegin><avEnd>2014/12/15</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityAt the intersection of Sec. 1, Zhonghua Rd. and Hengyang Rd.

It is situated at Fude Street, by the foot of Tiger Mountain of the “Four Beasts Mountains”. It originates from first the year of Tongzhi reign (1862). At that time, an ancestor from Tangshan came to Taiwan alone, and resided in the cave of Tiger Mountain. He hung a red silk writing that read, “The Heavenly Emperor and various deities” by the walls of the cave entrance, and set up an incense burner on the rock to worship it. However, the cave was damaged during the Japanese colonial period. In 1954, people rebuilt a temple with bamboo at the same location to pay tribute to the Heavenly Emperor. In 1959, it was officially named “Songshan Feng Tian Temple”. From 1967 to 1977, it continued to expand, where the main hall was renovated, and a pilgrim building and library were built. With a floor area of more than 3,300m2, the place is able to accommodate more than a thousand pilgrims. From here, one can overlook The Presidential Office Building, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall, CKS Memorial Hall, The Grand Hotel, International Trade Building, Grand Hyatt Taipei and City Hall, and is an excellent place of worship and enjoying the scenery.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/04/22</avBegin><avEnd>2015/08/17</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2015/08/17</xpostDate><file><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D586/E91/F379/a2a4baa0-9016-4a36-b5bb-2494ff226102.JPG</img><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D679/E280/F443/71e625a0-2cdc-44dd-bb91-0f48c6eb8ef2.JPG</img><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D53/E34/F952/ca92bf79-4a80-475d-8add-e0d4ac2ad096.JPG</img><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D616/E234/F920/591145a9-0c6a-4d87-80ac-db1361708abb.JPG</img><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D535/E960/F81/ad06ae25-bda0-4f4e-a6e8-103035c58b0e.JPG</img><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D141/E724/F297/0ee7da3b-d109-4498-975b-0ed1f6cedc03.JPG</img><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D543/E611/F621/95b6bb8f-621a-4953-b783-6e397a5880e8.JPG</img><img description="Songshan Feng Tian Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D805/E561/F861/67950b4f-8304-45e2-b982-1190b667dfbf.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.584668</longitude><latitude>25.037384</latitude><MRT>Yongchun </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>213</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>For the whole family</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015042200000001</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Taipei Children's Amusement Park</stitle><xbody>Taipei Children’s Amusement Park, built bythe Taipei City Government, stands on area of about 5 hectares.

It has well-preserved, enchanting scenic resources both in the outer and inner gardens, the principal room, the greenhouse for potted orchids, the rose garden, Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion and the Ciyun Pavilion, due to construction projects or renovations having been prohibited in the neighborhood for national security reasons. The Chinese-style inner garden is landscaped with a stream running under an artificial bridge, rock gardens, peculiarly shaped rocks, and a red-painted Chinese summerhouse, whereas the European-style outer garden with carpet bed of exuberant flowers, serves as a theme venue for the annual chrysanthemum exhibitions. The rose garden features 200 species and 4,000-odd plants with roses of varied hues during the peak blooming period from November through April, and was Madame Chiang’s favorite location for leisurely strolls. While the Chiang family was baptized in a Christian ceremony and held worship services in the Victory Chapel, the New Orchid Pavilion (aka Longevity Pavilion) is a Chinese-style quadrangular structure built in 1950 to host Mr. Chiang’s birthday celebrations; it also serves as a venue for various orchid shows.

The pools occupy roughly 1,000 square meters, and the area features a Japanese-style architectural design employing mostly natural materials such as stone and wood. The roof of the ticket booth and bathhouse consist of curved black tiles, which add to the classic Japanese atmosphere.The hot spring water in the park comes from Thermal Valley, and is derived from so-called green sulfur springs. The six public pools are located at different heights reflecting the sloping topography; four are hot pools, and two are cold pools. The temperature of the hot springs water varies between 38°C and 42°C, and decreases progressively as one goes downhill. This system allows bathers to select a hot spring pool with the temperature that suits them best.One benefit of bathing in an outdoor pool is that you can enjoy the gentle breeze, the pleasant sounds of nature, and the park's lush greenery as you soak. If you choose to bathe at night, the bright moon and countless stars will accompany you as you soak away the weariness and stress of urban life.It should be noted that, in order to maintain the cleanliness and safety of the pools and the surrounding environment, visitors must wear swimsuits when bathing, and must uphold bathing rules. The pools are open for six periods every day, and first open at 5:30 in the morning. Please visit the park's website for detailed bathing hours and other relevant information.Do you enjoy outdoor hot springs bathing?

It was also the means of living when the ancestors first came to this place. For example, Wu's charcoal kiln in Zhongzheng Mountain of Beitou has a history of more than 160 years.&amp;nbsp;Along Zhongzhengshan Hiking Trail (south of Datun Mountains), due to fuel requirement, the charcoal industry flourished after Taiwan retrocession, until the ‘70s. However, with the rise of the oil industry, the charcoal industry went into decline and almost disappeared from Beitou District altogether. Today, even though the charcoal industry is no longer part of the economic activity, it has been appropriately transformed into a local cultural asset. For example, within “Erqi Farm” of Beitou Farmers’ Association, there is a restored charcoal kiln which has stopped operation for 30 years. The top of the kiln is like an arched tortoise shell, and is covered with soil. A double-pitched thatched roof was constructed on top and a mono-pitched thatched roof, called “Gou-Zui-Liao-Zai” (dog mouth house), was constructed above the combustion chamber to keep away the wind and rain.

In 1961, it exchanged land with its neighbor, Tong-Yi Hotel, and was rebuilt as a two-story archaic style temple. Later, due to old age, the building underwent a large scale renovation, which started in 2000. The new building covers an area of 660m2, and has three storys and three levels of basement.The new Jing Fu Temple has exquisite carvings, and most of the building materials for this structure were imported from China to ensure quality. Besides the dragon pillars in front of the main hall which are carved from a piece of diabase, the Door Gods on the temple doors are also carved from a block of red sandalwood. A highlight of the building is the large piece of “Dragon Parade” carving on the ceiling, which differs from common caisson ceilings. Worshippers can see the vivid “Green Dragon” dancing when they look up. The “Eighteen Arhats” carving on both sides of the main hall on the third story blend in with the landscape drawing, portraying the beauty of religious art.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/04/22</avBegin><avEnd>2015/04/22</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongshan Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2015/04/22</xpostDate><file><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D125/E433/F686/97a58adc-4456-4f6c-9c26-de870a75a08d.JPG</img><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D194/E477/F26/022c8678-eb2e-4790-bb88-d5dfacff1437.JPG</img><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D780/E481/F109/3b090703-d033-44b5-8405-ed358c0c0764.JPG</img><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D176/E859/F413/406a3a9c-379a-48e5-9b95-5182e4a5854f.JPG</img><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D447/E759/F571/07e330e2-2151-4625-88ae-f83da609cea5.JPG</img><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D625/E648/F397/a7fa2d93-e4c2-4a9d-91f5-a756116559b6.JPG</img><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D116/E663/F406/30dac97a-4bdf-4ec6-a192-98ce0f7649f4.JPG</img><img description="Jing Fu Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D860/E755/F334/18dbebc3-9418-4866-bdd0-07c3b2048a84.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.525574</longitude><latitude>25.067017</latitude><MRT>Mingquan W.

The Center was built in the ‘50s, with a new architectural post-war Chinese classical style. The center consists of two main buildings: Nanhai Theater and Nanhai College. There are also Nanhai Outdoor Gallery and Nanhai Arts and Culture Square. The center oversees and promotes school arts education and research, as well as promotion and counselling activities. It is an important place for arts publication, learning and cultivating creative talents.&amp;nbsp;In 2006, Taipei Historical Buildings Review Committee reached a conclusion that the building (including Nanhai Theater and Nanhai College) should be considered a “historical building”.

An old man felt that the statue bore resemblance to Imperial Lord Wen Chang, the deity who looks after the fortune and reputation of people. Hence, they built a small temple on Lane 45 of Minsheng East Road to properly worship it. Later, most believers seeking academic success came to worship the statue.

However, since the landmark was destroyed in a flood in the 6th year of Emperor Qianlong reign (1741), the locals rebuilt the temple on Zhilan Street. Shen Nong Temple was known as “Zhi Lan Temple” in the old days. Due to the fact that the people worshipped Fu De Zheng Shen (the Earth God) as the main deity, it was hence also called “Fu De Temple”. During the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty, Shen Nong Emperor (also known as Emperor of the Five Grains) was established as the main deity, &amp;nbsp;the temple was hence renamed, “Shen Nong Temple”.&amp;nbsp;An ancient incense burner from the Qing Dynasty, a longevity tablet with the temple record from the Qing Dynasty, five steles from the Qianlong to Daoguang reigns, and a pair of stone pillars from the Japanese colonial period are among the historical monuments still extant.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/04/22</avBegin><avEnd>2015/04/22</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2015/04/22</xpostDate><file><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D472/E271/F838/dcdecebf-4b66-491d-b48a-565dc2d5396e.jpg</img><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D451/E803/F562/c8655c1e-c957-4a7e-a618-d6b1be77b25d.jpg</img><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D636/E728/F845/6e7bd958-b073-4590-aa99-e28df6284600.jpg</img><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D727/E934/F421/0fa1ec53-4e2e-451a-801c-21c4d4b179af.jpg</img><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D273/E77/F549/583b509a-a1e5-49ab-9ffd-d775e77da6c6.jpg</img><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D459/E741/F907/ffff24fe-f9f9-4d34-ad3c-51d77cd192b7.jpg</img><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D706/E796/F582/ef51b7b6-94c4-4e24-9cd7-8eeb8a748c6c.jpg</img><img description="Shilin Shen Nong Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D51/E187/F940/08519f33-7e5b-4e4d-ad04-92122ed503ce.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.526380</longitude><latitude>25.097807</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>233</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Outing Locations</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000008</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Cherry Blossom Tunnel at Fuxing 3rd Road</stitle><xbody>The well-known “Cherry Blossom Tunnel,” located at Fuxing 3rd Road, Datun Village, Beitou District, is a splendid sea of flowers that travels the entire length of the road.

It is believed that Li modeled the main church structure after Western houses of worship he found in China’s Xiamen area. As part of the Christian outreach efforts in Taiwan, the church installed a main structure in the early days of Japan’s Taisho period, reinforced with premium red bricks, excellent craftsmanship and a West-meets-East façade.&amp;nbsp;Christianity’s growing acceptance in Taipei from the late 19th to early 20th century is evidenced by the church’s key features, such as segregated seating, performed at a time when gender equality was unheard-of, and men and women were required to use the left and right entrances, separately. Despite its resemblance of its European precedents, this historic church has been praised as a rarity in contemporary Taiwanese architecture for its unique façade — with an exposed-aggregate finish that is half-Taiwanese, and half-European, stately yet welcoming — and thus designated as the City’s 100th historic monument. Among its little-known highlights is a musical clock, which comprises 25 bells of various sizes and marks noon (12:00 p.m.) with 7 different tunes on a rotating basis.</xbody><avBegin>2015/08/13</avBegin><avEnd>2015/08/17</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Datong Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 40, Ganzhou St.</address><xpostDate>2015/08/17</xpostDate><file><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D51/E780/F532/a30e4e40-69ab-47ae-ae4d-8caa980511b9.JPG</img><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D118/E584/F665/8e485daa-e094-48a8-8564-cba7511f8fbb.JPG</img><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D605/E35/F393/7c6acde0-39b8-47e2-959e-38707f1a907a.JPG</img><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D955/E380/F303/8628e263-78fa-48c4-a05e-9ca9377fe73a.JPG</img><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D229/E468/F856/b959feab-1d2e-4f7d-b883-2d1e17860e63.JPG</img><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D37/E773/F344/70b8ed29-7ef9-4045-b32c-ff119aada19c.JPG</img><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D165/E801/F781/17f4510a-2331-495b-87a3-b6cf4dd1aaf5.JPG</img><img description="Dadaocheng Branch of the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D751/E790/F4/3d9d0867-23cc-4d42-9f4c-52735fee0e35.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.512588</longitude><latitude>25.059526</latitude><MRT>Daqiaotou</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>235</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015042200000018</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate</stitle><xbody>Longanpo was situated at the northern side of Taipei Basin during the Qing Dynasty, near the mountainous area, where immigrants from Anxi of Fujian Quanzhou Prefecture found their permanent home. Ancestors of the Huang family came to Taiwan during the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty (1740), and first resided in Danshui’s Fanshuliao, before moving to Taipei Basin. The brothers from the fourth generation of the family built the house, which is today’s Lianrang Estate. Lianrang Estate was built in 1897, three years into the Japanese colonial period; exquisite building materials were used for erecting the estate. The house faces south and is surrounded by paddy fields. This red brick courtyard house among paddy fields is a typical Taiwan’s traditional farm house. This setting is also called “guardian dragons at the front of the house”. When the house was initially built, the left and right guardian dragons were the only mythical structures built. The outer guardian dragons were added when the house was extended later. The red bricks used were made in Taiwan, as they have better quality, richer red color and better workmanship. It has a double-pitched roof, and the ridge of the roof has a gentle curve, reflecting simplicity and unadornedness. The exquisite wooden carvings in the main hall is well-preserved. The unique materials and decoration bear the transitional characteristics of Taipei City’s century-old extant old farm house, from the Late Qing to early Japanese colonial period.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/04/22</avBegin><avEnd>2015/04/22</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Da'an Dist.,Taipei City</address><xpostDate>2015/04/22</xpostDate><file><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D938/E400/F147/5d4f41e8-6c80-4659-8279-6d864325a439.JPG</img><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D668/E781/F3/7ec70957-cac5-41bb-a726-3bcee858a87c.JPG</img><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D528/E303/F155/337caa0e-0ccf-417d-9e1e-6cd90b119287.JPG</img><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D206/E349/F339/13c4f785-0456-4b34-86d9-70e62c3a1f15.JPG</img><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D870/E757/F479/8dff5cf4-9290-480c-b848-82a8885d9b7f.JPG</img><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D406/E839/F932/c8df7fbe-e2e1-44a7-8520-593585382618.JPG</img><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D78/E181/F95/ac2d6f0e-0f81-4dcb-b8a3-d62c8582c156.JPG</img><img description="Longanpo Huang Family Lianrang Estate">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D448/E441/F11/ae57d236-5c75-4b98-b1a9-052d88f5ba73.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.539152</longitude><latitude>25.024224</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>236</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015042200000005</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Taipei Industrial Institute, the Red Building</stitle><xbody>Built in 1912, this was formerly a Taipei Prefecture Industrial Institute during the Japanese colonial period.

The institute was home to several departments, including chemical engineering, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, architecture, etc.&amp;nbsp;The walls of the building are laid with red bricks, with protruding pillars to make the façade more streamlined. Outside the two-story building are corridors that connect to other buildings. The air vents below the windows are made of cast iron, embedded with the institute’s crest.

Because the park was covered with grass, it was originally called "Grass Mountain." After the Japanese era, in order to commemorate the Ming Dynasty scholar Wang Yangming, Grass Mountain was renamed Yangmingshan in 1950, and the Yangmingshan Administration was set up to develop the national park.Yangming Park has an area of 107 hectares and is located mainly on Mt. Datun. With a height of 445 meters, the park is surrounded by Mt. Qixing in the rear, Mt. Shamao on the left, and Mt. Datun on the right. The park also has a great view of the ridges of distant Mt. Guanyin. The climate here is warm and humid, and thanks to relatively cool summer temperatures, the park is a perfect place to escape the heat. The park is the only natural place in Taiwan that possesses dormant volcanos, sulfur fumaroles, and hot springs.The park is planted with plum, cherry, peach, azalea and camellia blossoms, and consistently attracts throngs of people to view the cherry blossoms every spring. There is also a flower clock that is assembled from various seasonal flowers. Do not forget to take a picture with this flower clock, which is the showpiece of Yangming Park, when you are here.In Yangming Park, visitors can view the flowers in spring, escape the scorching heat in summer, watch the silvergrass flowers and colorful leaves in the fall, and soak in the hot springs in winter.

Besides agricultural activities, locals also raised ducks, caught clams and fish in the river as means of living. In the later days, due to river improvement works, the harbor gradually lost its functions. The history of Sanjiaodu witnessed the changes of Danshui River; it is a place with significant historical value.&amp;nbsp;Today, only a dozen sampan boats dock at Sanjiaodu, wordlessly recounting the stories of the jetty. Master Zheng, born in a ship building family in Sanjiaodu of Jiantan, Taipei, is one of Taiwan’s few remaining masters who build dragon boats by hand.

During a negotiation meeting in May, 1999— the purpose of which was to build a consensus over land use between community planners and representatives of NGOs, school faculty, parents and residents —a series of Local Leaders’ Workshops, hearings and general planning sessions were held. The assembly hall project had faced one challenge after another until its groundbreaking ceremony in 2002 and inauguration on October 19th of that same year. A successful example of property renewal, the assembly hall has not only given a new breath of life to an exquisite Japanese structure that was first unveiled in 1927, but also emerged as a hub of effort to preserve the neighborhood’s historical and industrial legacies in the midst of reinforced interest in community engagement.&amp;nbsp;Built on a 636-m2 estate opposite Wenshan District Office that shoulders Muzha Elementary School, with Jingmei River to its east, the assembly hall is an elegant symbol of grassroots support and heritage preservation, complete with an information desk, an auditorium and a multi-purpose outdoor space ideal for lectures, public art displays, the “Classroom under the Trees” participatory landscape projects, and exhibitions of all sorts.&amp;nbsp;In addition to photographic displays illustrating Wenshan District’s evolution and economic lifelines, the assembly hall’s two-story new building features exhibits and activities at irregular intervals that involve artists, civic groups or community organizations (on both floors, space is available for rent) in an attempt to encourage high-quality, culturally sophisticated living.&amp;nbsp;The assembly hall’s old, Japanese-era building was remodeled into an open exhibition space available for lease by individual visitors or groups for academic workshops and intellectually inspiring seminars. Stop by the old-meets-new Wenshan Public Assembly Hall and you will be impressed by how architecturally refined it is, as well as how historically, industrially and ecologically distinctive Wenshan District has always been!</xbody><avBegin>2015/08/13</avBegin><avEnd>2015/08/17</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wenshan Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 189, Sec.3, Muzha Rd.

The Rinbansho (quarters of a head priest), nevertheless, is a traditional Japanese residential structure and the Shuxin Hall (a.k.a., Tree Heart Hall) a modernist mix of bricks, European log cabins and Japanese roofing.&amp;nbsp;A series of government efforts have been made to renovate and reuse the culturally, historically and architecturally significant Nishi Honganji complex. Among others, the Nishi Honganji Square is transformed into an urban attraction and extension of the fashion-forward, buzzing Ximen neighborhood that lure shoppers to moments of nostalgia and memories, in hopes of bringing crowds back to the once-thriving Monga and recreating the area's former successes by attracting business interests.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 176-No. 243, Sec. 1, Zhonghua Rd.</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D79/E26/F635/21d859ec-bea6-4e76-b67d-fbdeb075dd11.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D120/E326/F381/377858ca-79f3-436d-9a77-e7dc0fdd2d40.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D430/E992/F724/6b300019-8533-4934-9182-7fff6ade4b1c.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D266/E389/F643/27570de1-587a-4ae9-b75b-36657f48a782.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D395/E509/F92/c108bc92-fb16-4c58-99b4-3d9d6cd02e69.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D91/E482/F155/f436b508-27d1-4db4-aa51-a3906cef274f.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D970/E793/F768/c3827374-47a3-4c9c-9f0b-12b45168ded1.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D100/E117/F213/c8210ff3-7769-4eeb-96ae-6929edefdf29.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D945/E533/F576/27969651-fc44-426b-893a-5e7324386aaa.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D615/E210/F143/a427d6ea-9c21-4522-a5df-6cb194c9f7c6.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D25/E445/F923/a4f06104-36db-4fa1-bb6b-bdfe27bd9f24.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D848/E0/F818/1a3837dd-b7ba-4822-b3ec-7399ea2569c5.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D312/E652/F293/1816535b-da8e-47ed-9799-452f67c77e75.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D831/E779/F913/66758b2d-edc8-4883-84bd-3e946e470b62.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D344/E258/F668/6b65cab1-2ba8-4a44-93f1-a0c5bd3ebddc.JPG</img><img description="Nishi Honganji Square">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D858/E102/F114/824c8322-b7aa-4909-9c16-8c60d1b127cb.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Ximen Station (Exit 1)→ Walk toward Xiaonanmen</info><longitude>121.507133</longitude><latitude>25.039735</latitude><MRT>Ximen </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>242</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Outing Locations</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000016</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Guting Riverside Park</stitle><xbody>Guting Riverside Park is located between Yongfu Bridge and Zhongzheng Bridge. You can reach the Park by cycling along Siyuan Street towards the direction of Taipei Water Park. Shrubs grown on the slope ingeniously form the wordings, “Guting Riverside Park”. Visit the Park on a summer afternoon, when the sun is not so strong, to enjoy the breeze. There are various sports facilities in the Park for citizens’ enjoyment, such as the tennis court, basketball court and skating rink. Enjoy the expansive green space and take a moment to take in a cool breeze under the bridge. Sports aficionados who often visit here for the facilities know that two adjacent tennis courts were built under the shade, allowing players to stay away from the sun while playing, making the courts an ideal place for a friendly game.&amp;nbsp;There is a rock climbing practice area and children’s playground under Yongfu Bridge, with a thick protective mat under the slide, a statement of the City Government’s thoughtfulness. It doesn’t seem difficult to adult onlookers as energetic children complete the 3-m high rock climbing wall but the climb is actually quite a challenge when you try it yourself. This is a good place to bring your kids to have fun and beat the summer heat. In the winter, this place will become a sea of garden cosmos, which will attract numerous visitors to stand and gawk. There are well-designed biking trails and lighting in the Park, attracting more cyclists to take their bikes out and enjoy a delightful summer night ride.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongzheng Dist.,Taipei CityBetween Yongfu Bridge and Zhongzheng Bridge</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D433/E559/F229/36dc27bd-d4f0-4f25-94fe-96e7b11fc56a.jpg</img><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D409/E587/F62/aa8b9969-a93d-483a-b422-c360f4682e7d.JPG</img><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D705/E349/F922/60e7deab-3a85-4a2d-bc71-c44aeeffc4fb.jpg</img><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D124/E539/F971/a1e441cd-4127-4594-8a51-4ce060cfe1ec.jpg</img><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D122/E238/F362/dc15f7ce-98df-46e1-9ce3-2fd8d522fe06.jpg</img><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D103/E99/F730/72719682-2749-4eac-99ae-81c54b900737.jpg</img><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D506/E844/F379/50314bdc-e570-4b40-a35e-d191753f6881.JPG</img><img description="Guting Riverside Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D208/E482/F209/c11d2131-cac3-4c37-a521-f50132640f32.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.523026</longitude><latitude>25.017992</latitude><MRT>Taipower Building </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>243</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>For the whole family</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000012</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TIME>Weekdays: 10:00 -17:00, weekends: 10:00 - 22:00</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Nangang Tea Processing Demonstration Center (Taipei Tea House)</stitle><xbody>The Center is Nangang’s latest landmark; it is less than a 20 minute drive from downtown Nangang.

The Center also supports a rich ecological environment. In early summer, fireflies can be spotted in the bushes, and during autumn, Osmanthus fragrance lingers in the air. It is also Taipei City’s only tea plantation landscape, where professional guides offer in-depth ecological tours on “Dustpan Lake Osmanthus Trail”, “Dakeng Creek Osmanthus Suspension Bridge Trail” and “Circular Boardwalk”.

Other members of the Church followed his example, decorating Christmas trees outside their homes and caroling in the neighborhood. Afterwards, other residents of the alley, who were inspired by the joyful, festive tradition, also joined in. With the joint efforts of the Chief of Jiqin Village Mr. Huang Shengzhong, carpenter Wen Yongyan, Associate Professor Pan Tongtai of Taipei Chengshih University of Science &amp; Technology and Father Lin of San’ai Church, the “Christmas Alley” started to expanded yearly, and its fame spread like wildfire. Now, every Christmas season, the decorating of Christmas trees is a center-stage festive activity for all residents. In December every year, the residents will voluntarily decorate their homes, and some may even begin planning and designing new ornaments or installations months in advance. It is as if the residents have reached a tacit agreement to light up the Christmas trees one week before Christmas, until Lantern Festival of the following year. The decoration of “Christmas Valley” in Jiqin Village is done on a household basis. The windowsills and yards of each house in the alley will be filled with exquisite designs.

After the firing range moved away, the site was converted to a strip-shaped Park built along the foot of Xianshan (Elephant Mountain). With shady trees, chirping birds and fragrant flowers, the Park has become a popular spot for morning joggers.&amp;nbsp;The noteworthy feature of the Park is that it is the only location in the City where tree frogs can be spotted. Taipei tree frog (Rhacophorus taipeianus) is a protected species endemic to Taiwan, with its size ranging between 3 and 5 cm and in different colours like yellow and green. It was discovered and named in 1978 by Prof Wang Chin-Jan of National Taiwan University. The tree frog sanctuary is located at the northeast corner of Zhongqiang Park. To provide tree frogs with a protected, sustainable habitat in Zhongqiang Park, Giant Elephant’s Ear and Ginger Lily are planted, alongside native species such as Tuberous Sword Fern, Cretan Brake Fern, Chinese Taro, Common Tree Fern and Bird’s Nest Fern; furthermore, a water pump was installed at the sanctuary to supply a fixed amount of water to the tree frog natural reserve, to preserve its wetland condition and thereby ensure habitat sustainability.</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei CityLane 150, Section 5, Xinyi Road</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D337/E492/F304/ee66cd06-7622-4372-9063-9c90901ed614.jpg</img><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D966/E255/F946/9785cf61-8635-4695-bce4-3caf31cd23fa.jpg</img><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D112/E54/F810/f5859d1b-cca3-4cb6-8652-e882cd63c4c3.jpg</img><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D62/E463/F511/78820305-b1da-49d1-a5c7-b02ab07742e0.jpg</img><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D43/E16/F325/96391baa-f9ad-4bec-8b4f-856a0de6d75a.jpg</img><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D865/E899/F122/8bbf5f90-564a-4652-973e-f2098b92018c.jpg</img><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D40/E529/F641/2216ae71-5979-4102-9b70-658d37ede1c8.jpg</img><img description="Zhongqiang Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D597/E490/F726/20a80544-bf55-4e2d-98a6-8d5f4691d212.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.570103</longitude><latitude>25.030446</latitude><MRT>Xiangshan</MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>247</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>For the whole family</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015081300000003</SERIAL_NO><MEMO_TIME>9AM-12PM; 2PM-5PM every day (closed on Mon.)</MEMO_TIME><stitle>Fire Safety Museum</stitle><xbody>Registering 7.2 on the Richter scales, the January 17, 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake — then Japan’s worst natural disaster since World War II, next only to the Isewan Typhoon — left 6,430 dead, 40,000-odd injured, more than 510,000 houses partially or fully destroyed. It also &amp;nbsp;caused private and public property losses, totaling 10 trillion yen. On July 10th of that same year, the newly restructured Taipei City Fire Department set about building Taiwan’s first fire safety museum and arming it with simulation features, in order to raise awareness about natural crises and the correct approaches to tackling them.&amp;nbsp;Employing computerized, electronic or mechanical simulations, the museum now offers quasi-physical experiences of various natural hazards — along with thorough mini-documentaries on their respective histories and characteristics — in the hope that visitors will make preparations accordingly for fires, floods, earthquakes, typhoons and other types of calamity part of their daily life. Fun tips are also incorporated into the exhibits to help visitors brace for the unexpected more efficiently.&amp;nbsp;In conveying what they have learned from those educational displays to friends and families, the museum-goers can spread the message and help to effectively avert the threat of disasters.&amp;nbsp;Keep in mind:&amp;nbsp;(1) All visitors will be charged an admission fee.

The Park got its name because its landscape is similar to that of Zhishan in Fujian’s Zhangzhou, whose people came to settle in northern Tamsui and Shilin during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. Historical monuments abound in the Park, with prehistoric cultural icons, including those of the Dabenkeng, Zhishanyan, Yuanshan and Botanical Garden eras, as well as the enchanting history and culture of the Qing Dynasty, Japanese Colonial period and Nationalist government. There is a century-old temple “Huiji Temple” in the Park, which was built in the 17th year of Emperor Qianlong’s reign in the Qing Dynasty. In 1979, the temple was designated as a Class 3 historical monument by the Ministry of the Interior, in which the main deity is Kai-Zhang-Sheng-Wang (Sacred Prince, Developer of Zhangzhou). Due to the fact that the Park is a well-preserved historical site, many ancient trees can be found here, including the icon of the Park, a 300-year-old Camphor tree grown next to the Yunong Reading Room. The extended weathering process has caused the landforms in the Park to figure various quaint sculptural formations, such as Elephant Rock, Cavity Rock, Onion Rock, Giant Rock and Snake Frog Rock, which are all excellent geological educational materials.</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Shilin Dist.,Taipei CityYusheng Street</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Zhishan Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D973/E388/F573/eed3f362-ea54-47d3-9931-0498612a36ef.JPG</img><img description="Zhishan Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D676/E702/F667/2566d012-c7c4-481c-9407-9f07b7a09533.JPG</img><img description="Zhishan Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D273/E348/F948/98cb4b9f-0c25-4a9f-9449-845f88f52583.JPG</img><img description="Zhishan Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D880/E84/F779/2e502f62-e6d9-4e07-8b09-be9e4f5481ac.JPG</img><img description="Zhishan Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D736/E237/F739/02b1d96a-84ed-423c-870c-d22be6194fa1.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D140/E731/F502/2f87c93a-d70b-414c-bd7e-59513ab9c5f1.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D783/E804/F114/e631ef97-b68d-47e1-8d08-f3baec8c0f39.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D422/E529/F258/383a38e8-ae0b-4391-b987-ef67bf52d111.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.531838</longitude><latitude>25.102140</latitude><MRT>Zhishan </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>249</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Other</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015112000000009</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Ximending</stitle><xbody>Ximenting is the mecca for youth culture.

Its former address was “Land No. 323, 6th Street, Nanmending, Taipei City, Taipei Prefecture,” and thereby was later named “Nanmending 323.” After years of neglect and lack of upkeep, the old Japanese-style building was restored in recent years with the assistance of renowned architects, Guo Zhong-Duan and Kenji Horigome. Mr. Motomi Oguchi from Japan’s Nagano Prefecture, who specializes in residential garden design, was also invited to design the Japanese rock garden.Scheduled tours: Saturdays, Sundays and National holidays: one session at 11:00 and 15:00, respectively; each session lasts 30 minutes</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Zhongzheng Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 53, Nanhai Road</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D879/E188/F517/70953c24-486f-4757-88ec-42ae26c32727.jpg</img><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D912/E796/F283/0a34cfa3-f8fc-46c1-969a-251d145af840.jpg</img><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D299/E641/F129/fabb6165-006b-4689-8752-5e4197289588.jpg</img><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D678/E816/F531/c1a8054f-da9d-4573-af04-fc49e6bcb4ba.jpg</img><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D97/E115/F33/cfd967fa-a34f-4982-b7d6-b80d84d13ad0.jpg</img><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D649/E742/F798/5807cdca-d0a5-44f8-8814-b8ed1adfa42a.jpg</img><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D291/E710/F24/6b887380-e2b4-45dc-8bcb-a1e73e06cf86.jpg</img><img description="Nanmending 323">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D51/E726/F13/9e73f42d-8750-45f5-aa9f-09b9e69898b4.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.511118</longitude><latitude>25.032515</latitude><MRT>Xiaonanmen </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>251</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Religious Venues</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000007</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple</stitle><xbody>In seeking tranquility for the mind and soul, and in hopes of spiritual guidance, the early settlers in Wenshan District transported Qingshui, a Chinese deity from their hometown, Anxi, and built a temple to enshrine it at the confluence point of Xindian River and Jingmei River, an area that was called the “Xizaikou”. “Wanqingyan” was completed in 1831 (the 11th year of Emperor Daoguang’s reign). Qingshui was named Chen Zhao (Yin) in Henan during the Song Dynasty. He was said to have helped alleviate drought in Anxi with his fervent prayers, the locals persuaded him to stay. He then stayed at Qingxi (today’s Anxi, Fujian) and practiced Buddhism for 19 years before attaining enlightenment, and was deified after death. He became one of the important deities in the Anxi region, and is also known by other names: Ancestor, Black-faced Ancestor, Dipped-nose Ancestor, Immortal Qingshui and Master Mazhang.&amp;nbsp;Given its proximity to Jingmei River, “Wanqingyan” was susceptible to floods. Having also experienced multiple road demolition works, it was relocated to the current site at long last, inside the levee, after its reconstruction. At present, in addition to the three statues of the god being treasures of the temple, there are important historical artifacts, such as the century old plaque with the inscription “Kai Men Gan Lu” (Open the door to receive sacred sweet dew) and the stone made “Wanqingyan” censer with “the 18th year of Emperor Daoguang’s reign” (year 1836) inscription. In early times, people used the stone censer as a whetstone, resulting in an obvious arc-shaped dent on its appearance. There is a cultural gallery set up beside the temple displaying photographs of the Jingmei area in the olden days. It is definitely worth your visit for a closer look.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wenshan Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 124, Wanqing Street</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D81/E645/F154/85fa4a61-3c30-4fa3-b9cf-840587ed2368.JPG</img><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D250/E134/F401/fdeb6135-86ae-4d7b-aee6-efb39c266419.JPG</img><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D291/E200/F572/dacb8d57-d1d4-4c8c-9471-bec1211278ec.JPG</img><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D919/E61/F225/6193fac9-ab41-454f-bec8-7c3eda643f53.jpg</img><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D896/E232/F754/070afedc-1b28-4220-a032-c4944ca512ba.jpg</img><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D459/E799/F838/66e012aa-8e4b-4803-94e6-8fd1eec98f1d.jpg</img><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D99/E631/F499/a6085683-3bd1-4971-a048-dc24d6627bfe.jpg</img><img description="Wanqingyan Qingshui Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D801/E845/F25/52ebbda6-f0d7-47e1-8624-fea1e275f368.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>From MRT Jingmei station (Exit 3), walk toward Lane 168 of Jingfu St.; the Temple is by the entrance of the Lane on the left-hand side</info><longitude>121.536220</longitude><latitude>24.995279</latitude><MRT>Jingmei </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>252</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Religious Venues</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000006</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Bunsan Church</stitle><xbody>In the early days, the transportation in Muzha District was very inconvenient as the town was located in the inland of Taipei basin, impeding Christian missionary outreach. In 1875 (the 1st year of Emperor Guangxu’s reign), Zhang Nai-Hong, a tea grower in Zhinan mountain area, went past Xindian area and met Professor Mackay (Rev. George Leslie Mackay), who was teaching the scriptures in the Bible’s Matthew 11:28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” Zhang was no stranger to extremely heavy cargoes, so the scripture left quite a strong impression. He began to believe in the Lord and went to church with his wife on Sundays since then on. Afterwards, Zhang became an elder in Xindian Church in 1878. As the journey to Xindian Church is long, Zhang set up “Neihu Church” (a branch of Xindian Church) in August 1891 at the ferry of Zhinan village (near Duxian Bridge of National Chengchi University). In 1897 (the Japanese colonial period in the Meiji era), Zhang and others &amp;nbsp;spent 30 dollars on the current estate, on which the the church was built, and named “Muzha Church.” Construction was completed on April 30th of the following year.&amp;nbsp;It was elevated to an official church on April 17, 1954. However, due to factional dispute, another group of believers set up “Xinxing Church” at a location less than 50 meters away on the same street. In 1962, with the effort of Taipei Presbytery of The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan, the two churches merged into one, which was named “Bunsan Church”. Reconstruction of the new church, currently known as the old church, was launched on April 22nd of the same year. Nevertheless, the church could not accommodate the expanding congregation. Hence the construction of another new church, which began on March 13, 1994 and the dedication service was completed on April 12, 1998 after a series of challenges. Opposite the church is the starting point of the Muzha Old Street; its current address is No. 27, Kaiyuan St. In the past, it was a midway destination for the travelling traders, but now it is just a general store. Its tilted roof and wooden window frames, however, still tell the stories of its former glory.&amp;nbsp;</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wenshan Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 27, Kaiyuan Street (Behind the District Office)</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D198/E298/F814/c9fcbbb6-bf21-44ed-bf5d-3d51d18003ee.JPG</img><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D563/E326/F580/183373db-3e76-4148-a53a-2fe1da5d9844.JPG</img><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D979/E714/F155/31d34575-84de-4383-95ae-bfff6438ad43.JPG</img><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D796/E993/F766/c0b98f4d-8513-477e-95ba-df9acdfa21ba.jpg</img><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D181/E513/F406/22f9b0a0-eb90-4619-a13f-124c5a63520a.jpg</img><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D691/E441/F945/e0851817-cb6c-49d7-9133-67821b716ddd.jpg</img><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D439/E484/F485/450d1df9-4cb5-4a90-81b1-60d80123a3da.jpg</img><img description="Bunsan Church">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D32/E680/F978/460a6abc-96d6-485b-bf12-dc578dd51d9b.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.569737</longitude><latitude>24.989110</latitude><MRT>Wanfang Community </MRT></Section><Section><RowNumber>253</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Religious Venues</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000017</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Neihu Mazu Temple</stitle><xbody>Early settlers who came to Taiwan saw Sections 1 and 2 of Huanshan Road of Neihu District at the foot of the mountains, and hence named it “Shanxia” (the foot of a hill). Hence, from Lane 411, Section 1of Neihu Road, and to the north of Section 2, to Sections 1 and 2 of Huanshan Road, it forms a corner of Neihu, where Neihu’s “Shanjiaojiao Mazu” is enshrined to bless the area. On the 2nd Saturday of the 3rd month of the Lunar calendar, grand events such as holy pilgrimage and Bihu fireworks festival will be held to celebrate Mazu’s birthday; these are Neihu’s largest religious events. “Neihu Mazu”, enshrined in Neihu Mazu Temple, has always been the center of local belief. However, something special is that in the early days, Mazu’s statue was enshrined by Neihu District’s representative of the believers on a rotational basis. In recent years, it is enshrined temporarily at the Preparatory Office of Neihu Mazu Temple on Lane 46 of Lishan Street, giving an odd spectacle of a god without a temple. However, it never diminishes the believers’ devotion.

Covering an area of 21 hectares, the Park is Nangang District’s biggest tree-covered area, offering an ideal recreational place for citizens and instilling a breath of new life into Nangang.Shanzhuku Sanitary Landfill Site earned its name because of its location at Shanzhuku Valley, the border between the south east corner of Nangang District, and New Taipei City’s Shenkeng District. It is Taipei City’s second standard sanitary landfill, covering an area of about 65 hectares. The landfill ground has an area of 30 hectares, and a capacity of about 6.17 million m3. 21 hectares of the landfill ground has already been filled and covered, and then converted into green space by means of vegetation restoration. It now has a totally different landscape from the former landfill, resembling the ambience described in the poem, “Fishermen”, written by Liu Zong-Yuan, a poet from Tang dynasty; the Park was hence named, “Shanshuilu Eco Park”.Various facilities in the Park were built with facilities you see now standing at the park, which were surprisingly abandoned at one time. There are also interactive and fun environmental education commentary facilities. In addition, on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 am to 4 pm, there are free children’ games (stilt walking, hoop rolling, top spinning) and free bicycle rental for visitors. The vast garden is also an ideal place for kite flying. During daytime, you can overlook downtown Nangang and Neihu’s mountainous region from the observation deck, while at night you can enjoy the night view of vehicles on Highways No.3 and No.5. The Park is an ideal recreational place for the entire family to get close to nature and experience ecological fun.</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Nangang Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 37, Nanshen Road</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D8/E435/F797/03a718fa-1b78-4e30-a086-3a8f8237bd2b.JPG</img><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D173/E755/F825/94b560cd-d211-457f-be46-50263561206a.JPG</img><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D948/E345/F295/bbfd1a7a-0f13-48b9-94ab-6fbba6ef5787.JPG</img><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D955/E961/F672/d900a460-ddbe-437d-a1ae-e1b54f7ea534.JPG</img><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D699/E624/F438/77fc2554-24df-4c06-8cd0-fd602a3aea51.jpg</img><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D386/E112/F447/74c5e5e0-7c29-4297-bf12-50eec832fef5.jpg</img><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D340/E370/F489/1fff3d9f-f390-4505-ba94-5e68efa2ceae.jpg</img><img description="Shanshuilu Eco Park">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D274/E152/F187/7089315d-9ba8-4437-a80b-ec0e97241238.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.622337</longitude><latitude>25.029077</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>255</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Religious Venues</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015121600000006</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Chen De-xing Hall</stitle><xbody>The Taipei Chen Clan Ancestral Hall, built by the Grand Architect, Chen Ing-Bin, has a front hall with a hip-and-gable and double-eave roof, wooden structure and unique dougongs (interlocking wooden brackets), and smooth curvy roof ridges and eaves.

It also protects the knees of faithful hikers, so you can enjoy Mother Nature without worrying about tripping on those outdoor walkways, which can get physically challenging sometimes. Another highlight of the trail project is an s-shaped elevated boardwalk that, at every turn on its zigzag course, promises spectacular vistas and draws gasps of amazement from visitors.Need a quick escape from the urban bustle and fatigue? Follow the trail to an amazing lake that is rather different from the cherry grove, yet equally breath-taking!</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Neihu Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 49, Bishan Rd.</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D313/E929/F745/32ef53f8-70c3-4f1c-be86-6eedd60c500e.jpg</img><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D131/E518/F999/08babd46-de7b-474d-a3de-d6d97959f486.jpg</img><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D927/E45/F605/c7642e72-e142-4b58-8d4d-ed4ec57a601a.jpg</img><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D721/E473/F394/af97d3c2-ec50-480c-8a79-b4544172ecd3.jpg</img><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D621/E134/F799/28300925-e2d0-4568-ae12-7611864faed5.jpg</img><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D460/E695/F781/c59b84f8-7c04-412b-95b9-60dec6e76675.jpg</img><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D488/E877/F953/f2010564-5a0a-4b59-b2b2-936cea77a0a8.jpg</img><img description="Lakeside Cherry Blossom Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D968/E390/F561/9a5dab1d-d758-4db7-a966-2615b09c20b3.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>Take MRT Wenhu Line and get off at Neihu Station (Exit 1) walk to the “Bihu Elementary School” bus stop in front of Jiantou Fude Temple (No. 452, Sec. 2, Neihu Rd.) switch to Mini Bus No. 2 (services available on a hail-and-ride basis in mountain areas).</info><longitude>121.590402</longitude><latitude>25.103330</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>257</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Outing Locations</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000010</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Tiaomi Historic Trail</stitle><xbody>“Tiao” in Tiaomi means “selling grains” in Chinese and “Tiaomi” means “peddling rice”. During the period between 1821 and 1850 (Emperor Daoguang’s reign), in a move to reduce time spent on transportation and labor, farmers in the Sanchangli area built this narrow mountainous trail as an alternative route to the smoother - yet longer - foot path. There are a total of 500 stone steps on this trail to facilitate quicker transportation of rice in regions like Nangang, Muzha, Shenkeng and Jingmei, and support more frequent trade activities. Since there is a Tiaomi Temple along the trail, the trail becomes its eponym, Tiaomi Historic Trail. “Tiaomi” also means “shouldering rice” in Chinese. Legend has it that due to the steep, treacherous steps, carriers at that time had to rest by the Temple when travelling across the region. To express their gratitude to the God of the Earth for blessing them with a safe journey, they would leave a bowl of rice while resting. As time passed by, the residents built a simple temple using stones to show their respect for the God. After several reconstructions, it became the current “Tiaomi Temple”. There is also the “Dexing Coal Mine Entrance” near the trail. Dexing Coal Mine started its operation about 1897, and reached its operating prime between 1946 and 1948. This was followed by the exhaustion of the coal vein. The site was abandoned, leaving only the mine entrance as a tourist attraction. The stone steps on Tiaomi Historic Trail resurfaced in 2011 along with the establishment of an arch bridge, wooden path and tourist signposts for the Trail.</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Xinyi Dist.,Taipei CityTiaomi Historic Trail, Rice Trail The end of Alley 100, Lane 600, Wuxing Street, Taihe Village</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D362/E319/F364/6826816d-4e57-46a9-a9e3-1710f29a0ef8.jpg</img><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D395/E342/F654/4f3fd01c-7fd7-4737-b419-5a7737d305cb.jpg</img><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D736/E894/F644/75bc3945-f6a8-40a1-a8d3-390e7f453803.jpg</img><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D133/E143/F398/5b98ad6c-ce33-497d-bc04-113455895f16.jpg</img><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D414/E141/F834/030d99e4-3d22-45fd-8272-ac92d8b801bf.jpg</img><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D736/E120/F609/80382db3-5ad4-4019-85ab-e5ad8830f36b.jpg</img><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D556/E399/F249/68c4a68f-ba62-4b13-bde7-686ce54ab26a.jpg</img><img description="Tiaomi Historic Trail">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D692/E78/F940/6dc2ff2f-f472-409b-b9aa-ce44b2f63d8a.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.572928</longitude><latitude>25.016211</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>258</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Historic Sites</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000004</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Remains of Taipei Prison Wall</stitle><xbody>During the 1910s, Japanese colonists erected a massive prison in Taipei and another one in Tainan as part of the move to suppress the anti-colonial uprisings that were intensifying across Taiwan. In a style common among 19th century correctional facilities worldwide, the now-defunct Taipei Prison featured cell blocks that radiate outward, and high walls made of stones up-cycled from the Taipei Prefecture bulwarks demolished in the 1910s. The prison wall is historically significant in part because they are composed of andesite and Qilian stone sourced during Emperor Guangxu’s reign from hillside quarries in Dazhi or Neihu, and transported to the shores of Keelung River; next they were shipped to the Hegoutou Wharf via Tamsui River by boat.

It was unveiled in 1760 and remodeled in 1838 (the 25th year of Emperor Qianlong’s and the 18th year of Emperor Daoguang’ reign, respectively) with its property management rights transferred to the neighboring Longshan Temple to avoid confiscation by Japanese colonists.Sitting on a west-east-facing lot, Dizang Temple was designed in the one-hall style of the mid-Qing period with its simple structure enhanced by unpretentious carvings, a 3-span façade, a “swallowtail” ridgeline, gable ends, a humpbacked rafter-and-purlin entrance corridor and round-based columns. Besides a wooden post-and-lintel framework comprising two crossbeams and three-guatong (melon-shaped short columns) — the crossbeams are connected by rafters from which lanterns are hanging — the main hall features a statue of Ksitigarbha, the chief deity whose birthday (30th of the 7th lunar month) is marked by a large-scale ritual celebration. Sitting at Ksitigarbha’s left hand is Lord North Pole; sitting to his right-hand side are the Taipei Prefectural Chenghuang (city god) and Marshal Tiandu — who were relocated from Taipei’s Prefectural Chenghuang Temple and Zilai Temple on Xiyuan Road, respectively, after Japanese colonists torn down their original places of enshrinement — alongside Generals Fan and Xie. The quaint censer on the offering table was, as its inscription indicates, presented in the autumn of 1899 (the 25th year of Guangxu era), 17 years after the temple plaque was installed above Ksitigarbha’s throne, and 2 years before the old-school incense burner first appeared in front of Generals Fan’s and Xie’s figurines. Not far away from the Dizang Temple is a sanctuary erected in 1760 to commemorate the “Lord of the Hordes,” mostly homeless spirits of single Chinese settlers who died in Taiwan. The sanctuary’s history is, to a great extent, intertwined with that of Dizang Temple.</xbody><avBegin>2015/10/14</avBegin><avEnd>2015/10/14</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Wanhua Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 245, Xichang St.</address><xpostDate>2015/10/14</xpostDate><file><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D28/E804/F900/bec38f6e-c849-46ef-87dc-bc319c0d7b6d.JPG</img><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D262/E943/F710/809698a0-85ee-47e7-8c04-cb6c96a34cf8.JPG</img><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D86/E509/F229/153563d7-003a-40d2-aafe-71501cca2226.JPG</img><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D21/E792/F39/6ffae7cf-3ef4-4886-99d5-6aed97b0c9cd.JPG</img><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D237/E651/F547/9e323542-4ca4-42eb-a3c5-88ab2fcbeaba.JPG</img><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C2/D132/E835/F613/284a6e2a-c1d2-4a33-995b-9bcefe017932.JPG</img><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D842/E458/F851/da8da761-e624-42c2-84cb-7a5819c83c34.JPG</img><img description="Monga Dizang Temple">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D774/E665/F901/7af40bd6-9f10-4229-800e-8bfc1bd3fd6e.JPG</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><info>MRT Longshan Temple Station (Exit 3) → Longshan Temple → Xichang St.</info><longitude>121.500684</longitude><latitude>25.036944</latitude></Section><Section><RowNumber>260</RowNumber><REF_WP>10</REF_WP><CAT1>景點</CAT1><CAT2>Outing Locations</CAT2><SERIAL_NO>2015101400000003</SERIAL_NO><stitle>Chiang Wei-shui Memorial Park</stitle><xbody>Formerly known as Jinxi Park, the 5,060-m2 Chiang Wei-shui Memorial Park in Dadaocheng is Datong District’s largest neighborhood park.&amp;nbsp;Chiang Wei-shui was a democracy activist and cultural visionary whose well-known feats — notably the founding of Da-an Hospital, Taiwan Cultural Society and The Taiwan Minpao (i.e. People’s News) wholesale headquarters — were mostly documented in Dadaocheng.

"The first door opens to display the beauty of Guanyin Mountain; thousands of ships have navigated over the running waters" is written on the front gate, pointing out the change of its location over the years. Cisheng Temple was originally located at the intersection of Xining North Road and Minsheng West Road back in 1866, across the trading port, with the Bali Guanyin Mountain to its front right, looking onto the bay of the Tamshui River flowing north. In 1910, the Japanese government tore the temple down to re-plot the urban streets. The locals funded the temple relocation to its current address on Yanping North Road, using the original pillars and stones and preserving its appearance since the reconstruction finished in 1914, until today.</xbody><avBegin>2015/12/16</avBegin><avEnd>2015/12/16</avEnd><idpt>臺北旅遊網</idpt><address>Datong Dist.,Taipei CityNo. 17, Lane 49, Baoan Street</address><xpostDate>2015/12/16</xpostDate><file><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D85/E685/F226/bd98227f-2050-43bd-a3b9-c4959b3ed178.JPG</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D445/E95/F397/92a9deeb-86e3-4366-a3a2-d74c7501a5da.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C1/D385/E874/F114/cb758b7d-dd37-425e-886f-896b94b85559.jpg</img><img description="">http://www.travel.taipei/d_upload_ttn/sceneadmin/image/A0/B0/C0/D250/E864/F39/196f5a32-a5df-4731-acfd-cf9d04ddf9a8.jpg</img></file><langinfo>20</langinfo><POI>Y</POI><longitude>121.512183</longitude><latitude>25.060246</latitude></Section></CommonFormat>
